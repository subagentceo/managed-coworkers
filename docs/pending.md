## Column 1 — Operator browser-driven (Claude-in-Chrome runbooks)

These are operator actions that an authenticated browser session can drive end-to-end via paste-into-`claude --chrome` prompts (Opus 4.7 recommended). Cited from `vendor/anthropics/code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome.md`.

| Issue | Runbook | Outcome | Time | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [#33](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/33) | [`cf-api-token.md`](./operator-runbooks/cf-api-token.md) | `secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers Scripts Edit + Secrets Store Write) | ~5 min | 🟡 pending |
| [#34](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/34) | [`cf-account-id.md`](./operator-runbooks/cf-account-id.md) | `secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `vars.CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_NAME` | ~3 min | 🟡 pending |
| [#35](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/35) | [`voyage-api-key.md`](./operator-runbooks/voyage-api-key.md) | `secrets.VOYAGE_API_KEY` (Phase 11.C only — OPTIONAL) | ~10 min | 🟡 pending (optional) |
| [#36](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/36) | [`code-scanning-toggle.md`](./operator-runbooks/code-scanning-toggle.md) | GH Code scanning enabled; flip `upload-sarif: true` | ~2 min | 🟡 pending |
| [#37](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/37) | [`github-pat.md`](./operator-runbooks/github-pat.md) | Fine-grained PAT + run `setup:project` + `setup:branch-protection` | ~8 min | 🟡 pending |

**Total operator browser surface: 9 runbooks (8 required + 1 optional). Sum of estimated time: ~41 min of operator attention.**

## Column 2 — Operator CLI-driven (after column 1)

These run after the corresponding browser runbook completes:

| Trigger | Command | Why |
|---|---|---|
| #37 done (PAT in clipboard) | `GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> npm run setup:project` | Creates GH Project v2 + 12 milestones + links existing issues |
| #37 done (PAT in clipboard) | `GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> npm run setup:branch-protection` | Creates `Protect main — no HITL` Repository Ruleset |
| #36 done (code scanning enabled) | (one-line PR auto-opened by heartbeat) | Flip `upload-sarif: false → true` in `.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml` |

## Column 3 — Autonomous agent follow-ups (no operator gate)

These are issues the heartbeat orchestrator picks up in a future session. Each can be worked WITHOUT operator action.

### Phase 12 (closeout follow-ups; operator-decision-gated only)

| Issue | Subject | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| [#39](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/39) | Phase 2.B — crawl 4 deferred vendors (brave-search, sentry, sift, twilio) | none (autonomous) |
| [#40](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/40) | Phase 6.B — codemode wiring in src/agent/run.ts | none (autonomous) |
| [#41](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/41) | Phase 7.B — install-plugins.ts real materializer | none (autonomous) |
| [#42](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/42) | Phase 11.B — `--batch-submit` + `--batch-collect` for live Anthropic Batches API | none (autonomous) |

### Phase 13 (content surfaces beyond docs + crawler modernization)

| Issue | Subject | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| [#45](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/45) | Phase 13.A — conditional GET (RFC 7232) + content-hash skip-write | none (autonomous; ANCHOR for #46-#48) |
| ✅ #46 | Phase 13.B — anthropic.com mirror | shipped via PR #161 as `vendor/anthropic-sitemap/` (sitemap-driven, 369 URLs, replaces narrower `vendor/anthropic-engineering/`) |
| ✅ #47 | Phase 13.C — claude.com/blog | shipped via PR #160 as `vendor/claude-sitemap/blog/` (129 posts via sitemap; replaces 4-category html-index discovery) |
| ✅ #48 | Phase 13.D — 4 marketing surfaces | shipped via PR #160 as `vendor/claude-sitemap/{customers,plugins,connectors,resources}/` (folded into consolidated mirror) |

### Phase 14 (docs refresh + RUNBOOK.md)

| Issue | Subject | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| [#49](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/49) | Refresh CLAUDE.md/DEVELOPER.md/README.md + new CONTRIBUTING.md + new RUNBOOK.md | none (autonomous; can proceed in parallel with #45) |

### Phase 15 (this milestone)

| Issue | Subject | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| [#50](https://github.com/subagentceo/knowledge-engineering/issues/50) | Phase 15 — codify project management (THIS milestone; PR for `PROJECT.md`/`pending.md` opened) | none |

## Suggested execution order

```
operator parallel:
  1. #36 code-scanning toggle (2 min) ──────────┐
  2. #34 CF account-id (3 min)                  │
  3. #33 CF api-token (5 min)                   ├─ ~30 min total
  4. #37 GH PAT + setup scripts (8 min)         │
  5. #38 Connector decision (read + decide)     │
  6. (optional) #35 Voyage key (10 min)         ┘

agent:
  → #45 (anchor) → #46 + #47 + #48 (parallel after #45)
  → #49 (parallel; docs)
  → #39 + #40 + #41 + #42 (parallel; can start anytime)
  → Phase 11.C activates after #35 + #45 land
```

After the 5 required operator runbooks complete: `npm run verify:gates` reports **0 operator actions pending**. After the autonomous follow-ups land: every phase rubric `status: done` and the chassis is feature-complete per `PRODUCTRD.md`.

## How to update this file

- After every runbook completes: flip 🟡 → ✅ + add the merge commit SHA
- After every issue closes: cross out the row
- After every new operator/agent ask: append a row in the right column
- A future `scripts/render-pending.ts` (Phase 15.D, optional) can auto-generate from GH issue labels (`needs:operator`, `kind:agent-followup`, `kind:operator-runbook`)
