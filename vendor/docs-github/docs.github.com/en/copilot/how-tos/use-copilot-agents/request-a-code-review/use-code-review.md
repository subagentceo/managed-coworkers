> \[!IMPORTANT] Starting June 1, 2026, Copilot code review runs will consume GitHub Actions minutes. For more details on this and how to prepare, see [Pricing and usage cost considerations for Copilot code review](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/models-and-pricing#pricing-and-usage-cost-considerations-for-copilot-code-review).

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot can review your code and provide feedback. Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

For a full introduction to GitHub Copilot code review, see [About GitHub Copilot code review](/en/copilot/concepts/code-review).

<div class="ghd-tool webui">

Copilot code review is also available for organization members without a Copilot license, when enabled by an enterprise administrator or organization owner. See [Copilot code review for organization members without a Copilot license](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review#copilot-code-review-for-organization-members-without-a-copilot-license).

## Using Copilot code review

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in the GitHub website. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, click the appropriate tab at the top of the page.

1. On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.

2. Open the **Reviewers** menu, then select **Copilot**.

   ![Screenshot of selecting 'Copilot' from the 'Reviewers' menu.](/assets/images/help/copilot/code-review/request-review@2x.png)

3. Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.

4. Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.

   ![Screenshot of a code review left by Copilot.](/assets/images/help/copilot/code-review/review-comment@2x.png)

   Copilot always leaves a "Comment" review, not an "Approve" review or a "Request changes" review. This means that Copilot's reviews do not count toward required approvals for the pull request, and Copilot's reviews will not block merging changes. For more details, see [Approving a pull request with required reviews](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews).

5. Copilot's review comments behave like review comments from humans. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.

   Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments will be visible to humans, but they won't be visible to Copilot, and Copilot won't reply.

## Working with suggested changes provided by Copilot

Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

If you're happy with the changes, you can accept a single suggestion from Copilot and commit it, or accept a group of suggestions together in a single commit. For more information, see [Incorporating feedback in your pull request](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request).

You can also invoke Copilot cloud agent to implement suggested changes. To do this, you must:

* Enable tools in Copilot code review and Copilot cloud agent.
* On review comments from GitHub Copilot code review, click **Implement suggestion**. This creates a draft comment on the pull request, where you can instruct Copilot to address specific feedback. Copilot will create a new pull request against your branch with the suggestions applied.

## Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews

You can provide feedback on Copilot's comments directly within each comment. We use this information to improve the product and the quality of Copilot's suggestions.

1. On a pull request review comment from Copilot, click the thumbs up (:+1:) or thumbs down (:-1:) button.

   ![Screenshot showing a Copilot code review comment with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.](/assets/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-controls@2x.png)

2. If you click the thumbs down button, you're asked to provide additional information. You can, optionally, pick the reason for your negative feedback and leave a comment before clicking **Submit feedback**.

   ![Screenshot of the form for providing additional information when you give negative feedback on a comment from Copilot.](/assets/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-modal@2x.png)

## Requesting a re-review from Copilot

When you push changes to a pull request that Copilot has reviewed, it won't automatically re-review your changes.

To request a re-review from Copilot, click the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-sync" aria-label="Re-request review" role="img"><path d="M1.705 8.005a.75.75 0 0 1 .834.656 5.5 5.5 0 0 0 9.592 2.97l-1.204-1.204a.25.25 0 0 1 .177-.427h3.646a.25.25 0 0 1 .25.25v3.646a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177l-1.38-1.38A7.002 7.002 0 0 1 1.05 8.84a.75.75 0 0 1 .656-.834ZM8 2.5a5.487 5.487 0 0 0-4.131 1.869l1.204 1.204A.25.25 0 0 1 4.896 6H1.25A.25.25 0 0 1 1 5.75V2.104a.25.25 0 0 1 .427-.177l1.38 1.38A7.002 7.002 0 0 1 14.95 7.16a.75.75 0 0 1-1.49.178A5.5 5.5 0 0 0 8 2.5Z"></path></svg> button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu. For more information, see [Requesting a pull request review](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

> \[!NOTE] When re-reviewing a pull request, Copilot may repeat the same comments again, even if they have been dismissed with the "Resolve conversation" button or downvoted with the thumbs down (:-1:) button.

## Enabling automatic reviews

By default, you manually request a review from Copilot on each pull request, in the same way you would request a review from a human. However, you can set up Copilot to automatically review all pull requests. See [Configuring automatic code review by GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-code-review/automatic-code-review).

## Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions

You can customize Copilot code review by adding custom instructions to your repository.

Repository custom instructions can either be repository wide or path specific. You specify repository-wide custom instructions in a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository. You can use this file to store information that you want Copilot to consider when reviewing code anywhere in the repository.

You can also write instructions that Copilot will only use when reviewing code in files that match a specified path. You write these instructions in one or more `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` files.

For more information, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * Copilot code review only reads the first 4,000 characters of any custom instruction file. Any instructions beyond this limit will not affect the reviews generated by Copilot code review. This limit does not apply to Copilot Chat or Copilot cloud agent.
> * When reviewing a pull request, Copilot uses the custom instructions in the base branch of the pull request. For example, if your pull request seeks to merge `my-feature-branch` into `main`, Copilot will use the custom instructions in `main`.

### Example

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```text
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, apply the checks in the `/security/security-checklist.md` file.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```

If you don't want to apply Copilot's suggested change, click the **Discard and Go to Next** button.

## Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews

You can provide feedback on Copilot's comments directly within each comment. We use this information to improve the product and the quality of Copilot's suggestions.

To provide feedback, hover over the comment and click the thumbs up or thumbs down button.

### Requesting a review when creating a pull request

You can request a review from Copilot when creating a new pull request using `gh pr create`:

```shell copy
gh pr create --reviewer @copilot
