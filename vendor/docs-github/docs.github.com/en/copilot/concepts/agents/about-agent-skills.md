## About agent skills

Agent skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Copilot can load when relevant to improve its performance in specialized tasks. The Agent Skills specification is an [open standard](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills), used by a range of different AI systems.

You can create your own skills to teach Copilot to perform tasks in a specific, repeatable way—or use skills shared online, for example in the [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repository or GitHub's community-created [`github/awesome-copilot`](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) collection.

You can also use `gh skill` in GitHub CLI to discover and install skills from GitHub repositories. For more information, see [Adding agent skills for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/cloud-agent/add-skills#managing-skills-with-github-cli).

Copilot supports:

* Project skills, stored in your repository (`.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills`)
* Personal skills, stored in your home directory and shared across projects (`~/.copilot/skills` or `~/.agents/skills`)

Support for organization-level and enterprise-level skills is coming soon.
