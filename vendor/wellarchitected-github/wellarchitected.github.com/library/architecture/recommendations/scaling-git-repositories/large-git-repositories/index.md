## Scenario overview[](#scenario-overview)

A company has been working on an application for several years. Over time, the repository has grown to an enormous size due to extensive code additions, large binary files, and a rich history of commits.

### Key Challenges[](#key-challenges)

1.  **Performance Issues**
    
    -   **Cloning and Fetching**: New developers joining the team face significant delays when cloning the repository for the first time, sometimes taking hours. Similarly, fetching updates and pulling changes become increasingly slow, impacting productivity.
    -   **Local Operations**: Operations like `git status`, `git log`, and `git diff` become sluggish, causing frustration among developers as even simple commands take longer to execute.
    -   **Repository Health**: The repository falls into an unhealthy state due to slow or failing maintenance and degrades overall performance, disrupting the development process.
2.  **Storage Constraints**
    
    -   **Disk Space**: The large repository consumes significant disk space, leading to increased costs for storage infrastructure.
    -   **Backup and Restore**: Regular backups of the repository take longer and consume more storage, complicating disaster recovery efforts.
3.  **Network Throughput**
    
    -   **Data Transfer**: High data transfer volumes strain the network, especially for remote teams, leading to slower internet speeds and higher costs for data transfer.
    -   **Service Quality**: Slow connections result in data transfers failing, further slowing development.
4.  **Repository Management**
    
    -   **History Bloat**: The extensive commit history, including large binary files and outdated dependencies, makes the repository bloated and difficult to manage.
    -   **Complexity**: Managing branches and merges becomes more complex and error-prone, especially when dealing with a large number of files and changes.
5.  **Collaboration Challenges**
    
    -   **Merge Conflicts**: The likelihood of merge conflicts increases with the size of the repository, causing delays and requiring more time for conflict resolution.
    -   **Code Review**: Code reviews become more challenging as larger changesets take more time to review, and the context can be harder to understand.
6.  **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline**
    
    -   **Build Times**: The CI pipeline experiences longer build and test times due to the sheer size of the repository, slowing down the feedback loop for developers.
    -   **Resource Utilization**: More resources are needed to process builds and tests, leading to increased costs and potential bottlenecks in the pipeline.

## Key design strategies[](#key-design-strategies)

This section defines the key design strategies that a company could employ to improve the experience of managing large software projects in Git:

### 1\. **Modularity and Decomposition**[](#1-modularity-and-decomposition)

-   **Repository Splitting**: Breaking down a monolithic repository into smaller, more manageable microservices or components. This reduces the overall size and complexity of each repository, making them easier to manage and work with. This strategy will have the greatest impact on reducing repository size, improving performance, and minimizing the risk of the repository entering an unhealthy state.

### 2\. **Efficient Storage Management**[](#2-efficient-storage-management)

-   **Using Git LFS**: Using Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage large files outside of the Git repository will help keep the repository size mangeable and improve performance for standard Git operations. Moving files to LFS after they have already been committed to the repository will require rewriting history. See [When to use Git LFS](/library/architecture/recommendations/scaling-git-repositories/when-to-use-git-lfs/).
-   **Managing Old Data**: A well-maintained repository not only improves collaboration but also reduces potential workload on Git servers. Cleaning up stale pull requests and removing or archiving obsolete branches and tags helps streamline the repository and minimize storage usage. Consistently maintaining a tidy repository will keep the size manageable and reduce the likelihood of performance issues.

### 3\. **History and Version Control Optimization**[](#3-history-and-version-control-optimization)

-   **History Rewriting**: Utilizing tools like [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) or [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to remove large, unnecessary files from the repository history, which helps in reducing repository size and improving performance.
-   **.gitignore Optimization**: Place `.gitignore` rules in the deepest possible directories to reduce evaluation overhead, significantly improving performance of client-side commands such as `git status`.

### 4\. **Improved Cloning and Fetching Mechanisms**[](#4-improved-cloning-and-fetching-mechanisms)

-   **Shallow Clones**: Encouraging the use of shallow clones (`git clone --depth=1`) or partial clones ([`git clone --filter=blob:none` or `--filter=blob:limit=<size>`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list#Documentation/git-rev-list.txt---filterltfilter-specgt)) to minimize the amount of data cloned, which speeds up the initial setup for new developers and reduces bandwidth usage.
-   **Shallow Directory Structure**: Deeply-nested directory structures increase the number of tree and blob objects created over time, which can lead to repository bloat and reduce the efficiency of object packing and delta compression during Git operations.
-   **Fetch Often**: The further the client and server drift from one another, the longer each push will take. Fetching regularly can reduce the time it takes to complete a push.

### 5\. **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**[](#5-enhanced-cicd-pipeline-efficiency)

-   **Optimized CI/CD**: Caching a repository can improve CI/CD performance by avoiding redundant work across jobs and pipeline runs. This can be achieved using a local repository mirror or the repository cache feature in GitHub Enterprise Server. Additional strategies - such as shallow or sparse checkouts, parallel builds, and incremental builds - will also reduce build times. These optimizations are especially important in large CI/CD environments, where simultaneous pipeline executions can create a “thundering herd” effect on GitHub resources.

### 6\. **Resource and Cost Management**[](#6-resource-and-cost-management)

-   **Network Bandwidth Optimization**: Reducing the amount of data transferred by leveraging techniques like shallow cloning and Git LFS, which lowers the strain on network resources and associated costs.
-   **Disk Space Management**: Using efficient storage solutions and archiving old data to free up disk space and reduce storage costs.

### 7\. **Improved Collaboration and Workflow**[](#7-improved-collaboration-and-workflow)

-   **Merge Conflict Reduction**: By splitting repositories and optimizing history, the likelihood of merge conflicts can be reduced, streamlining the collaboration process.
-   **Simplified Code Reviews**: Smaller, more focused repositories lead to more manageable changesets, making code reviews quicker and more effective.
-   **Batch Merges**: Group of merge requests to the same targeted for batch processing to reduce delays due to conflicts and stale branch in merging.

### 8\. **Incremental Adoption and Migration**[](#8-incremental-adoption-and-migration)

-   **Gradual Implementation**: Encouraging a phased approach to implementing these solutions, allowing teams to adapt to changes progressively without disrupting ongoing development activities.

### 9\. **Scalability and Flexibility**[](#9-scalability-and-flexibility)

-   **Scalable Repository Management**: Designing repository structures and workflows that can scale with the growth of the codebase and the team, ensuring long-term manageability and flexibility.

By employing these design strategies, companies can effectively manage large Git repositories, leading to improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced developer productivity.
