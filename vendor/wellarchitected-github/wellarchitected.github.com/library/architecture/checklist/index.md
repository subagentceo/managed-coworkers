Checklist for Architecture

# Checklist for Architecture

This assessment checklist focuses on evaluating and enhancing the **Architecture** aspect of your systems, ensuring they are designed for scalability, resiliency, efficiency, disaster recovery, modularity, interoperability, simplicity, and observability. By adhering to core design principles, this checklist aims to help you build robust, agile, and scalable infrastructure that aligns with long-term vision and growth.

ℹ️
