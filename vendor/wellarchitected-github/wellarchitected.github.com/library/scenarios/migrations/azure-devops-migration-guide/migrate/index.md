    -   Post-migration summary (end of day)
    -   Issue resolution updates (as needed)
    -   Success confirmation (after validation)

## Migration execution[](#migration-execution)

### Source environment preparation[](#source-environment-preparation)

-    Enable read-only mode for affected repositories:
    
    -   Configure Azure DevOps repositories as read-only
    -   Disable build triggers in Azure Pipelines
    -   Pause integration services and webhooks
    -   Document current active branches for verification
-    Take final backup of repositories for rollback if needed:
    
    -   Clone repositories with all branches and tags
    -   Archive Azure DevOps project configurations
    -   Export pipeline definitions and variable groups
    -   Capture current access control settings
    -   Document active work items and their states
-    Record key Azure DevOps settings:
    
    -   Branch policies and protection rules
    -   Security settings and access controls
    -   Build definitions and triggers
    -   Release pipelines and environments
    -   Service connections and credentials
    -   Work item process templates

### Repository migration[](#repository-migration)

Execute the migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer. For complete instructions, see [Migrating repositories from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud/migrating-repositories-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud).

```bash
# Basic migration command (all parameters are required)
gh ado2gh migrate-repo --ado-org your-org --ado-team-project your-project --ado-repo your-repo --github-org your-github-org --github-repo your-repo

# Common options
# --target-repo-visibility private     # Set visibility: public, private, or internal (defaults to private)
# --queue-only                         # Only queue the migration, don't wait for completion
# --verbose                            # Show detailed output
```

ℹ️

By default, `gh ado2gh migrate-repo` will run the migration and wait for completion. For large repositories, this may take several hours. Use `--queue-only` to queue the migration and check status separately with `gh ado2gh wait-for-migration`.

-    Monitor migration progress and review logs:
    
    -   Check the “Migration Log” issue automatically created in each migrated repository
    -   Download migration logs for offline analysis using `gh ado2gh download-logs --github-target-org your-org --target-repo your-repo --migration-log-file migration.log` (see [Accessing your migration logs](https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/accessing-your-migration-logs-for-github-enterprise-importer))
    -   Review migration warnings for data that didn’t migrate as expected
    -   Track completion times for performance benchmarking
    -   Keep stakeholders informed of progress
    -   Capture performance metrics for future planning
-    Handle migration errors:
    
    -   Review error logs to identify patterns
    -   Address issues based on troubleshooting guide
    -   Use `gh ado2gh abort-migration` to cancel problematic migrations if needed
    -   Retry failed migrations after corrective action
    -   Document workarounds for persistent issues
    -   Escalate critical blockers to support channels
    -   Update runbooks with solutions to common problems

### Verification[](#verification)

Verify the data and state of migrated repositories:

-    Repository content:
    
    -   All branches present (compare branch count)
    -   Commit history complete (validate commit counts)
    -   Tags present (check tag presence)
    -   Code security maintained (validate access controls)
-    Metadata:
    
    -   Pull requests (check status, comments, and work item links)
    -   Comments and reviews (check completeness)
    -   Labels and milestones (verify definitions)
    -   User attribution (review mannequins for reclamation)
-    Repository settings:
    
    -   Visibility (private/public/internal)
    -   Access controls and permissions
    -   Security scanning settings _(requires GitHub Code Security for private repositories)_
    -   Webhooks configured correctly
    -   Default branch name and merge settings
-    Test core workflows:
    
    -   Repository cloning and fetching
    -   Branch creation and pushing
    -   Pull request creation and merging
    -   GitHub Actions workflow execution
    -   Issue creation and management
    -   Code search functionality
-    Test critical integrations:
    
    -   Azure DevOps connections
    -   Authentication systems
    -   Required third-party tools
    -   Essential webhooks
    -   Core automation

### Mannequin reclamation[](#mannequin-reclamation)

After successful migration, you’ll need to map migrated users (represented by mannequins) to their GitHub identities:

-    Review mannequin accounts in the migrated repository:
    
    -   Check the “Migration Log” issue in the migrated repository for mannequin information
    -   Generate a CSV file of mannequins using `gh ado2gh generate-mannequin-csv`
    -   Review mannequins directly in the GitHub UI under repository settings
-    [Reclaim mannequins](https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/reclaiming-mannequins-for-github-enterprise-importer):
    
    **Important prerequisites:**
    
    -   Users must be granted access to the organization before mannequins can be reclaimed
    -   For Enterprise Managed Users, use `--skip-invitation` flag
    -   For standard organizations, users will receive an email invitation to accept
    
    ```bash
    # Create a CSV mapping file with this format:
    # mannequin-user-login,target-user-login
    # mannequin_1,actual_username_1
    # mannequin_2,actual_username_2
    
    # For Enterprise Managed Users:
    gh ado2gh reclaim-mannequin --github-org your-org --github-repo your-repo --csv mapping.csv --skip-invitation
    
    # For standard organizations:
    gh ado2gh reclaim-mannequin --github-org your-org --github-repo your-repo --csv mapping.csv
    ```
    
-    Validate mannequin reclamation:
    
    -   Verify attribution appears correctly in the UI
    -   Check pull request authorship
    -   Review remaining unclaimed mannequins
