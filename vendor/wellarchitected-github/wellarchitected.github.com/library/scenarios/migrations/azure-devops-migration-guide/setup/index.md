## Enterprise configuration[](#enterprise-configuration)

### Initial setup[](#initial-setup)

Setting up proper authentication and access controls is essential for a successful migration.

-    [Configure enterprise settings](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise)
    
    Setting
    
    Purpose
    
    Policies
    
    Ensure consistency across organizations
    
    Audit logging
    
    Enable centralized tracking
    
    Security controls
    
    Establish baseline protection
    
-    Review and configure key policies:
    
    -   Repository creation
    -   Organization permissions
    -   Security requirements
    -   Access controls

## Identity and access management[](#identity-and-access-management)

Identity configuration is critical for both GitHub access and Azure DevOps integration. Before proceeding, ensure you understand your identity provider and user management strategy.

-    Select your authentication strategy:
    -   **Individual accounts with SAML SSO**
        -   Allows existing GitHub.com accounts
        -   Flexible user management
    -   **Enterprise managed users**
        -   Complete identity lifecycle management
        -   Stricter access controls
        -   Users managed entirely through IdP

ℹ️

GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency requires Managed Users.

### Provider setup[](#provider-setup)

-    Configure identity provider integration:
    
    -   **[Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/github-enterprise-cloud-enterprise-account-tutorial)**
    -   **SCIM provisioning** for automated user management
    -   **Team synchronization** to map IdP groups to GitHub teams
-    Implement security controls:
    
    -   Two-factor authentication requirements
    -   Session management policies
    -   Access review schedules
-    Establish emergency access:
    
    -   Recovery codes and emergency access accounts
    -   Identity provider outage protocols
-    Set up monitoring:
    
    -   Authentication events
    -   User provisioning
    -   Identity integration health
    -   API usage and rate limits

## Azure DevOps integration[](#azure-devops-integration)

ℹ️

**Best Practice**: Configure Azure DevOps integrations before beginning repository migrations to maintain workflow continuity. Test connections in a non-production environment first to validate authentication and permissions.

### Pre-migration integration setup[](#pre-migration-integration-setup)

-    Review your [assessment findings](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/scenarios/migrations/azure-devops-migration-guide/assess/) for Azure DevOps service dependencies
-    Plan integration configuration based on your [project charter](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/scenarios/migrations/azure-devops-migration-guide/plan/) decisions
-    Test authentication methods between Azure DevOps and GitHub Enterprise Cloud
-    Validate service connections and permissions before migration begins

### Azure Boards integration[](#azure-boards-integration)

If planning to maintain Azure Boards integration:

-    Configure [Azure Boards app for GitHub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/install-github-app?view=azure-devops)
-    Prepare Azure Boards connection templates
-    Configure [work item linking patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/link-to-from-github?view=azure-devops)
-    Define notification rules and webhook configurations
-    Test work item references and commit linking

### Azure Pipelines integration[](#azure-pipelines-integration)

If planning to keep Azure Pipelines temporarily or permanently:

-    Choose your [GitHub authentication method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#access-to-github-repositories):
    -   **GitHub App** (recommended) - Uses Azure Pipelines identity, supports GitHub Checks
    -   **OAuth** - Uses your personal GitHub identity
    -   **Personal Access Token (PAT)** - Uses your personal GitHub identity with controlled permissions
-    Set up [GitHub repository connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) in Azure DevOps
-    Configure [build trigger policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#ci-triggers) for GitHub repositories
-    Test pipeline triggers and authentication

## Organization structure[](#organization-structure)

ℹ️

**Reference your assessment**: Before setting up your organization structure, review your findings from the [repository documentation](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/scenarios/migrations/azure-devops-migration-guide/assess/#repository-documentation) and [access patterns](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/scenarios/migrations/azure-devops-migration-guide/assess/#access-patterns) sections in your assessment.

This will help you understand how to properly structure teams and permissions based on your current Azure DevOps setup and repository organization.

        -   Define synchronization schedules and conflict resolution policies
    -   **For Enterprise Managed Users**:
        -   Use [identity provider groups](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/managing-team-memberships-with-identity-provider-groups) to manage team memberships
