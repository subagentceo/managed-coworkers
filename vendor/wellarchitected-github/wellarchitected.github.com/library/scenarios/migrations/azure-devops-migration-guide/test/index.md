## Test environment setup[](#test-environment-setup)

### 1\. Test organization configuration[](#1-test-organization-configuration)

Creating a separate test organization allows safe validation of the migration process.

-    Create a test organization in GitHub Enterprise Cloud
    
-    Configure core settings:
    
    Setting
    
    Purpose
    
    Authentication
    
    Match production SSO
    
    Team structure
    
    Mirror planned hierarchy
    
    Repository settings
    
    Test access patterns
    
    Rulesets
    
    Validate policies
    
-    Configure test security controls:
    
    -   Apply standard [repository rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)
    -   Enable appropriate [security scanning](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security) _(requires GitHub Code Security for private repositories)_
    -   Configure [IP access restrictions](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization) (if needed)
    -   Set up required permissions and roles
