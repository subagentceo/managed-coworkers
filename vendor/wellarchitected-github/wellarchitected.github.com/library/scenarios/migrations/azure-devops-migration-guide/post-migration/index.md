## Repository governance[](#repository-governance)

-    Configure [repository rulesets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) for governance at scale:
    
    -   Deploy enterprise or organization-level rulesets:

        -   Tag protection rules to prevent unauthorized tag deletion
        -   Push protection rules for code quality and security
        -   Required status checks and mandatory workflows
        -   Metadata restrictions (commit message formats, signed commits)
    -   Implement security best practices:
        -   Pull request requirements (minimum reviewers, dismiss stale reviews)
        -   Signed commit enforcement using ruleset metadata restrictions
        -   Force push restrictions and linear history requirements
        -   Code owner reviews for sensitive file paths
        -   Restrict bypass permissions to specific roles

        -   Issue templates
        -   Pull request templates
        -   Security policy
        -   Code of conduct
-    Apply [repository custom properties](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization):
    
    -   Business criticality levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    -   Compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
