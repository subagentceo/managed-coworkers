    -   [About migrations from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud/about-migrations-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud)
    -   [Building a migration inventory](https://docs.github.com/migrations/overview/planning-your-migration-to-github#building-a-basic-inventory-of-the-repositories-you-want-to-migrate)
-   **Microsoft Learn**
    -   [About GitHub integration with Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/cross-service/github-integration?view=azure-devops)

## Azure DevOps environment analysis[](#azure-devops-environment-analysis)

### Azure DevOps services assessment[](#azure-devops-services-assessment)

Identify which Azure DevOps services you want to retain to ensure your teams remain productive.

#### Azure Boards assessment[](#azure-boards-assessment)

-   **Active projects**
    
    > Decide whether to keep Azure Boards integration or move to GitHub Issues.
    
    -    Identify teams using Boards
    -    Document work item types and custom fields
    -    Map workflow customizations
    -    List integration points with repositories
    -    Catalog team dependencies on features

#### Azure Pipelines assessment[](#azure-pipelines-assessment)

-   **Pipeline configuration**
    
    > Plan your CI/CD migration approach and effort.
    
    -    Document pipeline types (classic UI based vs. YAML)
    -    List build and release definitions
    -    Map environment configurations
    -    Catalog variable groups, secrets and secure files
    -    Document service connections
    -    List deployment targets (consider migration alternatives if deployment groups are used)

### Integration dependencies[](#integration-dependencies)

Please refer to the training strategy in [project planning](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/scenarios/migrations/azure-devops-migration-guide/plan/) for assistance in training on any additional integration dependencies.

Understanding service relationships is key to maintaining workflows:

#### Work item relationships[](#work-item-relationships)

-   **Repository links**
    -    Repository references _(ensures traceability)_
    -    Pull request links _(preserves development history)_
    -    Commit links _(maintains audit trail)_
    -    Build references _(ensures CI/CD traceability)_

#### Pipeline dependencies[](#pipeline-dependencies)

-   **Build system links**
    -    Source repositories _(maps build triggers)_
    -    Artifact feeds _(ensures package continuity)_
    -    External services _(identifies integration points)_
    -    Environment resources _(maintains deployment capability)_

## Repository analysis[](#repository-analysis)

Analyzing repositories helps you plan migration batches and identify challenges early.

### Initial analysis[](#initial-analysis)

The GitHub Enterprise Importer (GEI) tool provides a starting point. Before running the tool, ensure you have credentials configured for Azure DevOps and GitHub:

-   [Personal Access Tokens Guidance for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud/managing-access-for-a-migration-from-azure-devops#personal-access-tokens-for-github)
-   [Personal Access Tokens Guidance for Azure DevOps](https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud/managing-access-for-a-migration-from-azure-devops#personal-access-tokens-for-azure-devops)

With configured credentials, use this command to generate an inventory report of your Azure DevOps environment:

```bash
gh ado2gh inventory-report
```

This command scans your Azure DevOps organization and generates CSV report files:

1.  **orgs.csv** - Organization overview with counts of team projects, repositories, and pipelines
2.  **pipelines.csv** - Pipeline definitions across team projects and repositories
3.  **repos.csv** - Repository details including size, activity metrics, and pipeline usage
4.  **team-projects.csv** - Team project statistics with repository and pipeline counts

⚠️

**TFVC Repository Limitation**: Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories cannot be directly migrated to GitHub. If your Azure DevOps environment includes TFVC repositories, you’ll need to either:

-   Convert TFVC repositories to Git within Azure DevOps first using [git-tfs](https://docs.github.com/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/importing-a-team-foundation-version-control-repository#migrating-with-git-tfs) or the [Azure DevOps TFVC to Git import process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/import-from-tfvc)
-   Plan to leave TFVC repositories in Azure DevOps if conversion isn’t feasible
-   Archive TFVC repository content separately if the repositories are no longer active

Identify all TFVC repositories during your assessment to plan appropriate conversion or retention strategies.

Review these reports to:

-   Identify repository sizes and activity levels
-   Map pipeline dependencies
-   Plan migration batches based on team projects
-   Identify repositories needing special handling

### Repository documentation[](#repository-documentation)

    -    Pull requests and issues _(for preserving development context)_
    -    Wiki content _(for documentation preservation)_
    -    Submodule usage _(requires special handling)_
    -    Repository hooks and webhooks _(identifies automation)_

### Integration inventory[](#integration-inventory)

Understanding your integration landscape ensures business processes remain functional:

-    Document current integrations:
    -   CI/CD pipelines - Ensures build and deployment processes continue
    -   External services - Maps third-party tools that need reconfiguration
    -   Webhooks - Identifies automation that needs updating
    -   Service connections - Maps authentication that needs to be recreated
    -   [Azure Boards linkages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/) - Maintains work item tracking functionality

### Access patterns[](#access-patterns)

Security and access control mapping ensures uninterrupted team productivity:

-    Document current access controls:
    -   User roles and permissions - Maintains security posture in GitHub
    -   Service accounts - Ensures automation continues functioning

    -   IP allow lists - Maintains network security policies
    -   Security policies - Ensures compliance requirements are met

## Analysis and planning[](#analysis-and-planning)

Strategic categorization helps optimize the migration process:

### Repository categorization[](#repository-categorization)

-    Categorize repositories by:
    -   Activity level (active/inactive) - Prioritizes critical repositories
    -   Size (small/medium/large) - Plans migration batches efficiently
    -   Complexity (simple/complex) - Estimates effort and identifies risks
    -   Migration priority (high/medium/low) - Creates logical migration sequence
    -   Required features (LFS, Actions, etc.) - Ensures necessary GitHub features are enabled
    -   Business criticality - Identifies repositories needing additional security

### Integration assessment[](#integration-assessment)

-    For each integration:
    -   Document GitHub equivalent
    -   Plan migration approach
    -   Identify potential challenges
    -   Estimate effort required
    -   Document API usage and potential rate limit impacts

### Access control mapping[](#access-control-mapping)

Use this table to map your Azure DevOps permissions to their GitHub equivalents:

Azure DevOps

GitHub

Project Collection Administrators

[Organization Owner](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)

Project Administrators

[Repository Admin role](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) via [Organization Teams](https://docs.github.com/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)

Contributors

[Repository Write role](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) via [Organization Teams](https://docs.github.com/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)

Readers

[Repository Read role](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) via [Organization Teams](https://docs.github.com/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)

Branch Policies

[Repository Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)

ℹ️

With GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can create [custom repository roles](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/about-custom-repository-roles) for more granular permission control beyond the standard Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, and Admin roles.

This can be particularly useful for complex Azure DevOps permission structures that don’t map cleanly to the built-in GitHub roles.

#### Mapping checklist[](#mapping-checklist)

-    Map Project Collection Administrators to Organization Owners
-    Create GitHub teams for Project Administrators with Admin repository role
-    Create GitHub teams for Contributors with Write repository role
-    Create GitHub teams for Readers with Read repository role
