### Define objectives and scope[](#define-objectives-and-scope)

-    Document migration goals:
    
    Goal
    
    Purpose
    
    Repository consolidation
    
    Streamline source control
    
    Collaboration improvements
    
    Enhance team efficiency
    
    Integration requirements
    
    Maintain business continuity
    
    Security and compliance
    
    Ensure governance
    
-    Define project boundaries:
    
    -   **Repositories**: Which code and artifact repositories are making the move?
    -   **Teams**: Who will be impacted: development teams, users, and stakeholders?
    -   **Timeline**: What is the project duration and what are the key dates?
    -   **Features**: What needs to come over: history, pull requests, work items, boards, pipelines?
-    Establish success metrics:
    
    -   Data integrity (100% code preservation)
    -   Performance (speed, system response)
    -   Integration availability
    -   User adoption
-    Define developer readiness criteria:
    
    -   **Productivity metrics**: Developer workflow completion times, successful repository operations
    -   **Competency checkpoints**: Training completion rates, hands-on assessment scores
    -   **Adoption indicators**: Active users on GitHub, pull request workflows
    -   **Support metrics**: Help desk ticket volume, resolution times for GitHub-related issues
    -   **Integration proficiency**: Successful use of Azure DevOps integrations, CI/CD pipeline operations
-    Document out-of-scope items:
    
    -   Legacy system maintenance
    -   Optional feature migrations
    -   Non-critical integrations

### Integration strategy[](#integration-strategy)

Decide which Azure DevOps services to keep using after migrating repositories to GitHub:

-    **Azure Boards decision**:
    
    -    Continue using Azure Boards for work item tracking
    -    Migrate to GitHub Issues and Projects
    -    Use hybrid approach (Azure Boards + GitHub Issues)
    -   Consider: Teams requiring continued access, work item linking requirements, process template dependencies, cross-repository relationships
-    **Azure Pipelines decision**:
    
    -    Continue using Azure Pipelines for CI/CD
    -    Migrate to GitHub Actions
    -    Use hybrid approach (Azure Pipelines + GitHub Actions)
    -   Consider: Release pipeline handling, service connection management, secrets and variables strategy
-    **Other services**:
    
    -    Azure Artifacts (package management)
    -    Azure Test Plans (testing)
    -    Azure DevOps Extensions and integrations

### Stakeholder management[](#stakeholder-management)

    -   Executive sponsor
    -   Project manager
    -   Technical leads
    -   Team representatives
