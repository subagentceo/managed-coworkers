## Scenario overview[](#scenario-overview)

Managing AI credits requires governance practices similar to those used for cloud infrastructure: pooled consumption, variable demand, tiered budget controls, and cost attribution. It also requires right-sizing model selection, managing context window usage, and accounting for task complexity.

Each Copilot license contributes a monthly AI credit allowance to a shared enterprise pool, and usage beyond that pool requires additional spend. Usage is driven by individual behavior rather than automated workloads, and the shared pool model means one user’s consumption directly affects another’s available included AI credits in the same enterprise account.

This article provides opinionated recommendations for managing AI credits and usage-based billing (UBB) through the lens of the [FinOps Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/framework/finops-framework). It defers to the authoritative sources for GitHub billing budget configuration and focuses instead on design decisions, trade-offs, and governance strategies.

ℹ️

This article assumes the post-1 June 2026 AI credits model rollout unless otherwise noted.

## Key design strategies and checklist[](#key-design-strategies-and-checklist)

### 1: Use layered budgets as guardrails, not as allocation[](#1-use-layered-budgets-as-guardrails-not-as-allocation)

Design budgets as concurrent guardrails, not as a top-down allocation tree. The layered budgets (enterprise-level → cost center → user) enforce spending limits at multiple levels simultaneously. The most restrictive budget applies: a user can be blocked by any budget layer when enforcement is enabled, even if their ULB and the enterprise-level budget both have remaining balances.

This approach prevents runaway spend while preserving user productivity. Each layer serves a different governance purpose: enterprise-level budgets cap total organizational exposure, cost center budgets delegate accountability to cost owners, and user-level budgets prevent individual overconsumption of shared resources.

User-level budgets (ULBs) are recommended as the only hard enforcement caps, while enterprise and cost center budgets act as monitoring guardrails unless explicitly configured to stop usage.

### 2: Distinguish governance goals for included AI credits and additional spend[](#2-distinguish-governance-goals-for-included-ai-credits-and-additional-spend)

Design distinct governance approaches for each spending phase. A billing cycle has two phases: the included AI credits phase (where usage draws from the pre-paid pool) and the additional spend phase (where usage incurs additional charges after the pool is exhausted). While it is useful to think about these phases separately, current controls do not fully isolate governance between them.

For the included AI credits phase, the primary goal is fair access to a shared pool. Without guardrails, a small number of heavy users can exhaust the shared pool before others benefit. User-level budgets (ULBs) serve as the primary mechanism to moderate this behavior and promote more balanced consumption. For the additional spend phase (post-pool spend), the goal shifts to controlling financial exposure. Enterprise and cost center budgets help cap the additional cost your organization is willing to incur.

With UBB, the controls overlap rather than operate independently by phase. ULBs apply across both included credits and additional spend, while enterprise and cost center budgets apply only after the included credits are exhausted. As a result, ULBs serve a dual role: ensuring fair consumption of the shared pool while also acting as a guardrail on overall usage. Enterprise and cost center budgets remain the primary controls for managing additional spend exposure.

Maintaining this distinction keeps your governance approach coherent. It clarifies the different goals at each phase — fair consumption during the included AI credits phase and cost control during the additional spend phase.

### 3: Establish cost attribution before you optimize[](#3-establish-cost-attribution-before-you-optimize)

Build a reporting pipeline that answers “Which cost centers consume what, and at what cost?” before making any budget or policy changes. GitHub provides a downloadable CSV usage report with per-user, per-model, per-day breakdowns. Use this as the foundation for all optimization decisions.

Without attribution, budget adjustments and model restrictions become guesswork. Cost visibility is a prerequisite for informed governance — you cannot right-size budgets or identify waste without first measuring consumption patterns.

### 4: Align usage guidance with cost transparency[](#4-align-usage-guidance-with-cost-transparency)

Publish guidance that ties model tier to task complexity and makes the cost difference visible to users. Token costs vary significantly across models, and context window usage can drive up consumption quickly.

When users understand the cost implications of model selection and context window usage, they can make informed trade-offs between capability and consumption. This is the AI equivalent of right-sizing compute instances: match the resource to the task.

### FinOps checklist[](#finops-checklist)

The Start phase establishes minimum viable governance, the Adopt phase adds cost center-level controls and reporting, and the Advance phase automates and scales.

#### Start phase[](#start-phase)

-   Design the layered budget structure with stakeholder input
-   Define roles and assign response ownership for usage threshold alerts
-   Communicate budget policies and thresholds to all Copilot users before enforcement begins
-   Set an enterprise-level AI credit budget as the baseline monitoring guardrail for additional spend
-   Set a universal ULB to prevent any single user from consuming a disproportionate share of the pooled AI credits
-   Identify power users (e.g. agentic workflows, frontier model usage) and plan custom ULB overrides

#### Adopt phase[](#adopt-phase)

-   Create cost centers mapped to business units and assign additional spend budgets to each
-   Apply custom ULB overrides for defined profiles (e.g. power users)
-   Build a cost attribution and reporting pipeline using the AI usage CSV report
-   Map usage data to users and cost centers for showback reporting
-   Publish usage guidance that ties model tier to task complexity
-   Establish the operating model with alert response process and task cadence
-   Establish a review cadence: weekly during rollout, monthly once stable

#### Advance phase[](#advance-phase)

-   Automate budget management via the REST API (bulk ULB overrides, cost center mapping, budget adjustments)
-   Implement chargeback
-   Forecast pooled AI credits exhaustion based on observed trends
-   Integrate AI credit reporting with enterprise FinOps tooling

## Assumptions and preconditions[](#assumptions-and-preconditions)

-   Your organization uses **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** (GHEC) with Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise licenses.
-   You have **enterprise owner** or **billing manager** access to configure budgets and cost centers.
-   Your enterprise has an established FinOps practice, or at minimum a role responsible for metered cost governance.
-   Cost centers in GitHub billing are already configured, or you are willing to set them up to align with your monitoring requirements.
-   You have access to the enterprise AI usage report (CSV download available from billing settings).
-   User identities can be mapped to business units for cost attribution.

## Recommended implementations[](#recommended-implementations)

### Step 1: Design the layered budget structure[](#step-1-design-the-layered-budget-structure)

GitHub’s AI credit budgeting uses a layered structure with three budget levels: enterprise-level, cost center, and ULBs. Each layer serves a different governance purpose, and they operate concurrently to enforce spending limits. See [Understanding Copilot budgeting](https://support.github.com/product-guides/github-copilot/get-started/understanding-copilot-budgeting) for definitions and how these budget layers interact.

Design your budget layers by asking targeted questions at each governance level:

**1\. User-level: What is the responsible monthly spend per user?**

-   What was the average individual spend during the pilot?
-   Where are we in the AI SDLC rollout plan?
-   What new agentic use cases are we adopting in the coming months?
-   What new AI capabilities are we building?
-   What is the persona and usage-tier mix (developer, reviewer, SRE, data, business user)?

**2\. Scoped level: Which teams or groups need their own additional spend budget on top of the pooled AI credits?**

-   What is each group’s forecast consumption above the pooled allowance?
-   Which projects depend on frontier models or agentic workflows that consume credits faster?
-   How variable is their month-to-month usage (seasonality, release cycles)?
-   How do we treat shared platform teams vs product teams in the allocation (showback vs chargeback)?
-   Who is the accountable budget owner authorized to lift or hold a scope-level cap?
-   Which time-bound budgets must be ring-fenced (POCs, hackathons)?
-   What signal tells us a scope cap is too tight (throttling productive work) vs too loose (no friction on waste)?

**3\. Enterprise-level: How much autonomy should cost owners have over spending?**

-   What is the total enterprise AI envelope for the fiscal year?
-   What is our monetary commitment vs on-demand PAYG strategy?
-   What share sits in the pooled credit reserve vs pre-allocated to cost centers?
-   What guardrails, alert thresholds, and approval gates apply to additional spend?
-   How do we handle chargeback or showback across business units once pooled credits are exhausted?
-   What is the escalation path when the pool is depleted mid-cycle (throttle, top-up, or block)?
-   How do we forecast for headcount changes, M&A, and new AI capability launches?

### Step 2: Communicate budget accountability to stakeholders[](#step-2-communicate-budget-accountability-to-stakeholders)

Before configuring anything, ensure all stakeholders — users, cost owners, and finance — understand how the layered budgets affect them, where accountability lies, and how they can monitor their own usage.

#### Assess your change management needs[](#assess-your-change-management-needs)

For users and cost owners new to layered AI credit budgets, publishing diagrams and example scenarios can help them understand budget accountability and what happens when limits are reached.

#### Key points to communicate[](#key-points-to-communicate)

-   **Each user is accountable for their own budget.** The ULB is the ultimate spend cap per user. Once exhausted, the user is blocked from all Copilot features (except code completion and next edit suggestions) regardless of remaining budget at any other layer.
-   **Cost center budgets govern scoped additional spend.** Users assigned to a cost center share that additional spend budget. The cost owner is accountable for monitoring and managing that budget.
-   **Users not assigned to a cost center fall under the enterprise-level budget.** If a user is not mapped to any cost center, their additional spend is governed solely by the enterprise-level budget. Ensure these users are identified and accounted for.
-   **The most restrictive budget applies.** Whichever budget has the least remaining amount determines whether a request proceeds — a user can be blocked by any layer.

Note that default user-facing messages may not clearly indicate which budget layer caused a block. Support processes and self-serve dashboards should account for this.

#### Example scenarios[](#example-scenarios)

Publish concrete example scenarios like the following to make the budget rules tangible for users:

Example scenario 1:

> **“I have budget left, why am I blocked?”** Alex has a ULB of $200. The enterprise included AI credits pool is still available, and Alex’s cost center has $10K remaining. But Alex has already consumed $200 in AI credits from the shared pool this month. Alex is blocked because the ULB is the per-user hard cap — the remaining balance in other budgets does not override it.

Example scenario 2:

> **“The enterprise budget is exhausted — will the platform stop?”** The Platform Engineering cost center has a $50K additional spend budget. The enterprise-level budget ran out on the 20th, and cost center usage is configured to **exclude** from the enterprise budget. The Platform Engineering team can continue using Copilot because their cost center budget still has remaining balance. Only users not assigned to Platform Engineering cost center are affected by the exhausted enterprise budget.

#### Enable self-serve usage monitoring[](#enable-self-serve-usage-monitoring)

Provide users and cost owners with a way to check their own consumption so they can self-govern usage before hitting their ULB and cost center budgets. For example, users can [view usage in their IDE](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/monitor-premium-requests#viewing-usage-in-your-ide).

### Step 3: Set the enterprise-level additional spend budget[](#step-3-set-the-enterprise-level-additional-spend-budget)

Navigate to your enterprise billing settings and create an AI credit budget sized to your total enterprise AI envelope for the fiscal year, adjusted for your monetary commitment and PAYG arrangement. This is your **baseline** guardrail for additional spend. Set this even if you plan to use cost center budgets, because users not assigned to any cost center are only governed by this budget.

#### Enterprise-level budget configuration[](#enterprise-level-budget-configuration)

-   Budget type: Bundled AI credit budget
-   Scope: Enterprise
-   Option: Exclude cost center usage
-   Disable: “Stop usage when budget limit is reached”
-   Enable: Budget threshold alerts (75%, 90%, 100%)
-   Assign alert recipients: billing manager(s) and enterprise owner(s)

Recommend **disabling “Stop usage when budget limit is reached”** at the enterprise level to avoid a single global cap that causes engineering disruptions.

#### Enterprise-level budget scope option[](#enterprise-level-budget-scope-option)

If you are planning to implement cost center budgets, decide whether the enterprise-level budget should **include** or **exclude** cost center usage:

-   **Include** (default): Cost center usage counts against both the cost center budget and the enterprise-level budget. The enterprise-level budget acts as a global cap.
-   **Exclude**: Cost center usage is only governed by the cost center budget. Users in cost centers can continue spending even after the enterprise-level budget is exhausted. Users outside cost centers are still governed by the enterprise budget.

Recommend **exclude** for most enterprises, especially if a significant share of spend is pre-allocated to cost centers rather than held in a shared reserve. With this option, each cost center’s additional spend budget acts as a _dedicated and isolated_ budget for that group — if other cost centers exhaust the enterprise-level budget, cost centers with remaining balance continue operating without interruption. This prevents one cost center’s overconsumption from blocking others’ productivity. It also simplifies budget forecasting: each cost owner can plan against their own budget ceiling without accounting for others’ spending patterns. See [Centralized enterprise budget vs. delegated cost center budgets](#centralized-enterprise-budget-vs-delegated-cost-center-budgets).

### Step 4: Create budgets with cost centers[](#step-4-create-budgets-with-cost-centers)

For Copilot AI credits in a GHEC enterprise, cost center budgets must be attached to a **cost center**. Create one or more cost centers and assign an AI credit budget to each, sized to each scope’s forecast consumption above the pooled AI credits, with additional allowance for month-to-month variability. This answers the question: “When the pooled AI credits run dry, how much additional spend is _this_ group allowed to incur?”

ℹ️

A user can only belong to **one cost center**. However, **multiple budgets** still apply simultaneously (ULB, cost center budget, and enterprise-level budget).

When creating a cost center, you need to choose either **organization** or **user-based** scope. See [Management methods](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/billing/premium-request-management).

Recommend **user-based cost centers** when your organizational structure does not map cleanly to budget ownership, or when users frequently span multiple organizations. User-based cost centers give you direct control over exactly which users fall under each budget without requiring changes to org membership or Copilot license assignment. For enterprises with clean org-to-team mapping and SCIM provisioning, organization-based cost centers reduce ongoing maintenance.

ℹ️

**ULB and user-based cost center budgets are two different layers**. ULBs are _user-level_ spend caps that apply to each user regardless of cost center assignment. User-based cost centers are _groups of users that share_ a cost center budget for additional spend. Users in a user-based cost center are still subject to their ULB.

Examples of how to scope user-based cost centers, informed by responses from [Step 1](#step-1-design-the-layered-budget-structure):

-   **By role or function:** group all platform engineers into one cost center and application developers into another, regardless of which orgs they belong to. This addresses how to treat shared platform teams vs product teams in the allocation. Roles with higher AI intensity (e.g. agents, frontier model usage) get budgets sized to their forecast consumption above the pooled allowance, while lighter roles operate under tighter guardrails.
-   **By budget tier:** create a “power users” cost center for staff whose projects depend on frontier models or agentic workflows, and a “standard users” cost center for everyone else. Size each tier’s budget to its actual consumption profile rather than applying a uniform cap that either over-provisions or under-serves.
-   **By business unit:** assign users from, for example, Finance, Engineering, and Product each to their own cost center to enable chargeback or showback aligned with P&L ownership. Designate an accountable budget owner per cost center who is authorized to lift or hold the scope-level cap.
-   **By project or initiative:** temporarily group users working on a high-priority initiative (POCs, hackathons, time-bound projects) into a dedicated cost center with a ring-fenced additional spend budget. This lets you measure the AI credit cost per deliverable and evaluate ROI.

If there is planned month-to-month variability (seasonality, release cycles), proactively monitor whether the cap is throttling productive work or providing too little friction on waste.

ℹ️

If you already use cost centers for chargeback across other products (Actions, Code Scanning), you cannot create a second set of cost centers purely for AI credit budgeting. Use ULBs for user-level differentiation in this scenario.

#### Scoped budget configuration[](#scoped-budget-configuration)

-   Budget type: Bundled AI credit budget
-   Scope: Cost center (organization-based or user-based)
-   Disable: “Stop usage when budget limit is reached”
-   Enable: Budget threshold alerts (75%, 90%, 100%)
-   Assign alert recipients: billing manager(s) and cost owner(s)

### Step 5: Set user-level budgets[](#step-5-set-user-level-budgets)

User-level budgets (ULBs) define the _individual spending authority_ for each user — the total amount of AI credits a single user can consume in a billing period, regardless of whether those credits come from the shared pool or additional spend. ULBs are the only budget layer that **caps total user consumption across both pooled credits and additional spend**, making them critical for preventing a small number of heavy users from exhausting the shared pool before others can benefit.

#### Recommended approach[](#recommended-approach)

1.  Set a universal ULB as the default for all users. Size it using average individual spend from your pilot, plus additional margin for your current rollout stage and planned AI capability growth. See [ULBs and developer productivity](#ulbs-and-developer-productivity).
    
2.  Identify power users early — those adopting agentic use cases, frontier models, or new AI capabilities — and set custom ULB overrides sized to their persona and usage pattern. Each custom ULB is a 1:1 assignment to a user.
    
3.  To unblock a user mid-month, apply custom ULB overrides temporarily until the next billing cycle.
    

#### Universal ULB configuration[](#universal-ulb-configuration)

-   Budget type: Bundled AI credit budget
-   Scope: Users
-   Enable: “Stop usage when budget limit is reached”

### Step 6: Build a cost attribution and reporting pipeline[](#step-6-build-a-cost-attribution-and-reporting-pipeline)

GitHub provides a downloadable CSV usage report. This data includes `aic_quantity` (AI credits consumed) and `aic_gross_amount` (estimated USD cost). Build a reporting pipeline that maps usage to users and cost centers, and surface insights to inform budget adjustments and model guidance. See [Prepare for usage based billing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/prepare-for-usage-based-billing).

#### Cost attribution approaches[](#cost-attribution-approaches)

-   **Chargeback model:** At month-end, use the usage report to identify consumption by user. If one business unit’s users consumed a disproportionate share of the shared pool, allocate those costs back to that unit using your internal finance processes.
-   **Showback model:** Publish per-cost center dashboards without charging back. This creates accountability and awareness without the overhead of internal billing.

### Step 7: Publish usage guidance[](#step-7-publish-usage-guidance)

Token costs vary dramatically by model, and context window size drives consumption further. Provide users with guidance on:

-   **Responsible context usage:** Minimize unnecessary context in instructions to reduce token consumption.
-   **Model selection by task complexity:** Match model tier to the task. See [models comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison) and [models pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/models-and-pricing).

### Step 8: Establish the operating model[](#step-8-establish-the-operating-model)

#### Response process for budget threshold alerts[](#response-process-for-budget-threshold-alerts)

Define who receives each alert and what action they take:

-   **75%:** Billing Manager reviews consumption trajectory. No action required unless the trend projects exhaustion before month-end.
-   **90%:** Billing Manager escalates to cost owner. Evaluate whether to increase the budget or restrict usage.
-   **100%:** If “Stop usage” is enabled, users are blocked automatically. Cost Owner decides whether to raise the budget or leave the block in place until the next billing cycle.

### Step 9: Review and adjust on a monthly cycle[](#step-9-review-and-adjust-on-a-monthly-cycle)

UBB consumption patterns will emerge over time. During the first three months, review weekly. After that, shift to monthly reviews aligned with your billing cycle.

Review checklist:

1.  Compare actual consumption against budgets at enterprise, cost center, and user levels.
2.  Identify users or cost centers consistently hitting budget limits, interview them to understand usage practices and emerging patterns, and detect anomalies (e.g. unattended or autonomous usage).
3.  Analyze usage trends, particularly when during the month the pooled AI credits are exhausted. Consider whether to right-size additional spend budgets, add ULB overrides, or publish guidance to educate responsible usage.
4.  Aggregate weekly data to identify the top 5–10% of consumers.
5.  Remediate and update forecasts based on observed trends.

## Additional solution details and design considerations[](#additional-solution-details-and-design-considerations)

### Profile usage based on consumption patterns and use cases[](#profile-usage-based-on-consumption-patterns-and-use-cases)

Not all users consume AI credits equally. Some may be power users running agentic workflows with frontier models, while others may be light users leveraging smaller models for code completion. Profiling users based on their consumption patterns and use cases can help you plan and forecast more accurately, and identify who may need custom ULB overrides.

Examples of usage patterns:

-   Piloting new AI capabilities and enablement
-   Agentic workflows with frontier models
-   Migration factory with Copilot agents
-   Landing zones operations with Copilot agents
-   Burst usage in POCs, hackathons, tech conferences, and time-bound projects
-   Doubling down on seasonal projects (e.g. retail app for Black Friday, end-of-quarter functions, tax season)

Proactively profile users and their usage patterns, configure cost center budgets, and assign custom ULB overrides. This prevents users from being blocked mid-task while still maintaining overall cost governance.

### ULBs and developer productivity[](#ulbs-and-developer-productivity)

The goal of a ULB is to manage unplanned spend and cap outlier consumption, not to restrict typical usage.

Initially, set a high universal ULB to avoid blocking productive work. If the universal ULB is too low, it risks blocking users mid-task. Blocked users lose access to all Copilot features (except code completion and next edit suggestions) until the next billing cycle, or until an admin intervenes with custom ULB overrides.

Start with the per-seat included AI credits value plus a margin. You can use pilot data to inform this margin. Monitor for the first two billing cycles, then periodically review and adjust as user behavior and use cases evolve.

### Centralized enterprise budget vs. delegated cost center budgets[](#centralized-enterprise-budget-vs-delegated-cost-center-budgets)

Approach

Benefit

Risk

Single enterprise-level budget, no cost centers

Simple to manage

No cost center-level accountability; hard to attribute costs

Cost centers excluded from enterprise-level budget

Each cost center has a dedicated and isolated budget

Total enterprise spend is delegated; requires individual cost center budget sizing

Cost centers included in enterprise-level budget

Global cap plus cost center visibility

Enterprise-level budget can block others that still have cost center budget remaining

For organizations with 100+ seats, use cost centers mapped to organizations with the enterprise-level budget set to **exclude** cost center usage. This gives each cost center a _dedicated_ amount that cannot be consumed by other cost centers — cost owners can forecast against their own budget without other cost center dependencies. The enterprise-level budget then acts solely as a backstop for users not assigned to any cost center. Set a universal ULB as the cross-cutting safety net.

### Scaling budget management for large enterprises[](#scaling-budget-management-for-large-enterprises)

For enterprises with thousands of users, managing custom ULBs through the UI is impractical. Use the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/billing/budgets?apiVersion=2026-03-10) to:

-   Bulk-create custom ULB overrides.
-   Programmatically map users to cost centers.
-   Set and adjust enterprise-level and cost center budgets.
