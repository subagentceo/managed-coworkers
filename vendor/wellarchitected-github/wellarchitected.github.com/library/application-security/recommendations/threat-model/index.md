Updated December 10, 2025

## Scenario overview[](#scenario-overview)

Source code repositories are a prime target by threat actors to ultimately compromise an application or system. This threat model aims to identify and mitigate the risks associated with GitHub repositories.

The threat model is tightly scoped to the _**Source Integrity**_ section of **Supply Chain Security** as illustrated in the left side of the diagram below. The scope informs both the threat actors and the threats themselves. The threat actors may contain threats within themselves which highlights the various ways a threat actor could gain access to a GitHub repository.

_Figure attribution: This diagram is derived from the [SLSA Supply Chain Threats model](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats), version 1.0, from the [SLSA Framework](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa).

## System analysis[](#system-analysis)

GitHub has the role of a multifaceted platform acting not only as the sole source code repository but as something that encompasses version control, project management, CI, issue and bug tracking, automation, etc.

There are a number a ways both humans and machines authenticate and interact with GitHub

-   GitHub Account
    
-   Okta Session
    
-   Personal Access Tokens and SSH keys
    
-   Enterprise Apps
    
-   3rd Party Apps
    
-   Non-MFA Service Accounts
    

There are a number of these authentication mechanisms that reside outside of a company’s trust boundary. There is an extension of the trust boundary which is identified by having limited control mechanisms in place. For example, once an access token has been created and granted access, there is no control over the token from the customer’s organization.

There are a number of public repositories which require extra controls compared to the private repositories where anyone on the Internet can access them where it’s possible to submit a change to the code. There are a number of “types” of repositories

-   Repos that contain code that is shipped to a customer or pushed internally
    
-   Repos that are essential to the supply chain where they’re responsible for backporting or maintaining services
    
-   Repos that are not officially supported by the customer but are free for a customer or the community to download and run
    
-   Repos that are not products or offerings - anything else etc.
    

Beyond authentication there are a number of roles within a GitHub repository, there is the concept of GitHub teams which can be assigned a role, and there are outside contributors.

![Trust Boundary](image2.png)

## Methodology[](#methodology)

The threat modeling follows the _GitHub Threat Modelling Framework_ where at a high level the following questions are addressed:

1.  What are we working on?
    
2.  What can go wrong?
    
3.  What are we going to do about it?
    
4.  Did we do a good enough job?
    

The process starts with system decomposition where it is broken into components which involves producing a diagram. Then identifying assets, trust boundaries, threat actors, and existing controls that are in place. Threat enumeration is next, analyzing each threat and producing suggested mitigations against those threats.

## Threat actors[](#threat-actors)

TA-01 A threat actor with Internet access

TA-02 A threat actor who has a GitHub Account

TA-03 An threat actor who is an [outside collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators)

TA-04 A threat actor who has gained access to an employee’s GitHub credentials

TA-05 A threat actor who has gained access to an employee’s Okta session

TA-06 A threat actor who has gained access to a GitHub token (inc. SSH keys, PAT, etc.) which is authenticated against a customer org

TA-07 A threat actor who has compromised a third-party GitHub application

TA-08 A threat actor who has exploited a misconfigured or vulnerable GitHub Enterprise application

TA-09 A threat actor who is an insider e.g. a user who makes a mistake, a disgruntled employee, or contractor

## Threats[](#threats)

T-01 A threat actor searches public repositories with the goal of finding valid secrets e.g. password, access token, API key, etc.

T-02 A private repository is accessed by an unauthorized threat actor

T-03 A threat actor can change settings in the “Danger Zone”, unintentionally or maliciously

T-04 A threat actor modifies or deletes an important branch’s commit history, unintentionally or maliciously

T-05 A threat actor submits an unauthorized change

T-06 A threat actor approves and merges their own pull request (PR) to an important branch

T-07 A threat actor compromises a customer’s GitHub repository

T-08 A threat actor exploits a misconfigured GitHub Workflow or Action

## Threat analysis and recommendations[](#threat-analysis-and-recommendations)

Access controls restrict who can access the repository and what actions they can perform. This minimizes the attack surface and limits the potential for unauthorized changes.

Branch protection ensures that certain branches, especially critical ones like the main production branch, have strict controls in place. This helps prevent hasty or unauthorized merges.

Authentication measures, especially MFA and strong password policies, protect user accounts and make it more challenging for unauthorized actors to gain access in the first place.

Secret Scanning can help proactively identify exposed secrets in the repository, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Enabling automated Secret Scanning Push Protection mechanisms can prevent secrets from being committed to the repository; blocking before they are exposed.

### T-01 A threat actor searches public repositories with the goal of finding valid secrets e.g. password, access token, API key, etc[](#t-01-a-threat-actor-searches-public-repositories-with-the-goal-of-finding-valid-secrets-eg-password-access-token-api-key-etc)

The goal of the threat actor is usually to gain unauthorized access to systems, exfiltrate data, or misuse credentials for malicious purposes.

#### Analysis[](#analysis)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Threat actors could gain unauthorized access to customer accounts, systems, or resources.
        
    -   Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, further malicious activity within customer systems, financial losses, and damage to a customer’s reputation.
        
2.  Targets:
    
    -   Secrets like API keys, access tokens, and credentials stored within code
        
    -   Configuration files, hard-coded values and documentation may inadvertently contain secrets.
        
3.  Attack Vectors:
    
    -   Automated scanning tools and scripts to search for secrets within code and the commit history.
        
    -   These secrets may be exposed due to oversight from the person committing a change or an inadvertent inclusion in code.
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations)

1.  Education and Awareness:
    
    -   Educate contributors about the importance of not including secrets in code and how to safely store and share secrets.
        
    -   Ensure teams are aware of the robust secret management systems available to them, e.g. HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Action Secrets
        
2.  Security Scanning
    
    -   Deploy automated scanning tools to proactively search for and detect exposed secrets
        
    -   If exposed secrets are identified, have a response plan in place where the secrets are immediately rotated
        
3.  Secret Policy:
    
    -   Establish and enforce clear security policies and guidelines for secret management and access controls.
        
    -   These guidelines should include an overall secret management lifecycle, from creation to utilization to rotation and revocation.
        
4.  Code Reviews:
    
    -   Include checks for secrets and sensitive information during code reviews to catch inadvertent commits / exposure
        
    -   Anything found within a code review should be revoked and rotated
        

### T-02 A private repository is accessed by an unauthorized threat actor[](#t-02-a-private-repository-is-accessed-by-an-unauthorized-threat-actor)

This change can expose close source code, and data to a threat actor who could publicly expose it or expose it to a limited number of threat actors e.g. sell it.

#### Analysis[](#analysis-1)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Could expose sensitive proprietary information, proprietary algorithms, internal tools, and/or confidential data. This could trigger severe financial, legal, and reputational consequences for the customer.
2.  Targets
    
    -   The customer’s GitHub organizations that contain private GitHub repositories
        
    -   The customer’s user’s sessions or credentials
        
    -   Token’s that have access to the customer’s GitHub organizations
        
    -   Access to another system that would lead to gaining access to GitHub e.g. Vault
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Social engineering, tools to steal sessions, secret scanning tools run against source code repositories, unintentional leaks through video walkthroughs or documentation, leaked dumps of databases and other systems on the black market and generally exposed secrets
        
    -   An employee unintentionally making a repository public without understanding the consequences
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-1)

1.  Access Controls and Permissions:
    
    -   Only authorized personnel should have the ability to modify visibility settings where strong access controls and permissions are set for all repositories.
        
    -   Role-based access controls should be in place following the principle of least privilege. Limit the number of individuals who can modify settings to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unintentional changes.
        
2.  MFA & Fine-grained tokens:
    
    -   Require MFA for all access to repositories.
        
    -   In the case of bots and programmatically adjusting settings the use of fine-grained access tokens should be favored. For the majority of these cases they should not have access to adjust the visibility settings so if a token was exposed it can be revoked by the customer and the scope of the functionality it can perform is reduced.
        
3.  Monitor and Audit Settings:
    
    -   Monitor for changes and ensure alerts are in place for any changes to visibility settings.
        
    -   Have regular auditing in place against repository settings to ensure that the visibility of the repository has not changed.
        
4.  Incident Response Plan:
    
    -   Ensure teams are aware of the ways they can report a security incident
5.  Education and Training
    
    -   Ensure employees’s are educated in the many forms of social engineering
        
    -   How to manage secrets
        
    -   Modern attack vectors e.g. [Evilginx](https://help.evilginx.com/docs/intro)
        

### T-03 A threat actor can change settings in the “Danger Zone”, unintentionally or maliciously[](#t-03-a-threat-actor-can-change-settings-in-the-danger-zone-unintentionally-or-maliciously)

These actions include

-   Change repository visibility
    
-   Disable branch protection rules
    
-   Transfer ownership
    
-   Achieve this repository
    
-   Delete this repository
    

#### Analysis[](#analysis-2)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Change Repository Visibility:
        
        -   Could expose sensitive proprietary information, proprietary algorithms, internal tools, and/or confidential data. This could trigger severe financial, legal, and reputational consequences for the customer.
            
        -   Changing from public to private could limit community collaboration.
            
        -   Disable Branch Protection Rules:
            
            -   Could allow unauthorized changes to important branches, compromising data integrity and code quality.
        -   Transfer Ownership:
            
            -   Could result in the repository being controlled by an unauthorized entity, potentially exposing sensitive proprietary information, proprietary algorithms, internal tools, and/or confidential data. Also reputation damage.
        -   Archive the Repository:
            
            -   This would make the repository read-only and could disrupt development and usage.
        -   Delete the Repository:
            
            -   There might be a loss of code, version history, documentation, and other project-related data. However, data can be recovered up to [90 days](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/restoring-a-deleted-repository) so a period of distribution to productivity is more likely in the case of deletion.
                
            -   This can disrupt software development, potentially result in financial losses, and damage an organization’s reputation.
                
2.  Targets
    
    -   User’s sessions or credentials
        
    -   Token’s that have access to the customer’s GitHub organizations
        
    -   Access to another system that would lead to gaining access to GitHub e.g. Vault
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Social engineering, tools to steal sessions, secret scanning tools run against source code repositories, unintentional leaks through video walkthroughs or documentation, leaked dumps of databases and other systems on the black market and generally exposed secrets
        
    -   An employee unintentionally changing one of these settings
        
    -   A machine user unintentionally changing one of these settings
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-2)

1.  Define a Policy
    
    -   Have a GitHub Security Best Practice Policy
        
    -   Ensure every GitHub repository can adhere to the policy
        
2.  Access Controls and Permissions:
    
    -   Only authorized personnel should have the ability to modify visibility settings where strong access controls and permissions are set for all repositories.
        
    -   Role-based access controls should be in place following the principle of least privilege. Limit the number of individuals who can modify settings to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unintentional changes.
        
    -   Ensure modification of these setting is not possible through automation (at least in most cases) where a human always needs to confirm
        
3.  MFA & Fine-grained tokens:
    
    -   Require MFA for all access to repositories.
        
    -   In the case of bots and programmatically adjusting settings the use of fine-grained access tokens should be favored. For the majority of these cases they should not have access to adjust the visibility settings so if a token was exposed it can be revoked and the scope of the functionality it can perform is reduced.

    -   Ensure employees’s are educated in the many forms of social engineering
        
    -   How to manage secrets
        
    -   Modern attack vectors e.g. [Evilginx](https://help.evilginx.com/docs/intro)
        

### T-04 A threat actor modifies or deletes an important branch’s commit history, unintentionally or maliciously[](#t-04-a-threat-actor-modifies-or-deletes-an-important-branchs-commit-history-unintentionally-or-maliciously)

#### Analysis[](#analysis-3)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Could lead to a failure of data integrity
        
    -   Could lead to disruption of software development
        
    -   Could lead to disruption, downtime for customers, and breaking SLAs for cloud production systems
        
2.  Targets
    
    -   Customer’s GitHub important branches within both public + private repositories
        
    -   Customer’s ability to develop and release code
        
    -   Employees’s sessions or credentials
        
    -   Token’s that have access to the customer’s GitHub organizations
        
    -   Access to another system that would lead to gaining access to GitHub e.g. Vault
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Social engineering, tools to steal sessions, secret scanning tools run against source code repositories, unintentional leaks through video walkthroughs or documentation, leaked dumps of databases and other systems on the black market and generally exposed secrets
        
    -   An employee unintentionally overriding the commit history of an important branch
        
    -   A misconfiguration issue within the repository or a security setting has not been applied
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-3)

-   Have a GitHub Security Best Practice Policy
    
-   Ensure every customer’s GitHub repository can adhere to the policy
    

1.  Access Controls and Permissions:

### T-05 A threat actor submits an unauthorized change to an important branch[](#t-05-a-threat-actor-submits-an-unauthorized-change-to-an-important-branch)

#### Analysis[](#analysis-4)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Could lead to a failure of data integrity
        
    -   Could lead to disruption of software development
        
    -   Could lead to disruption, downtime for customers, and breaking SLAs for cloud production systems
        
2.  Targets
    
    -   Customer’s GitHub important branches within both public + private repositories
        
    -   Customer’s ability to develop and release code
        
    -   Customers’s production systems on cloud e.g. Serverless
        
    -   Customer’s sessions or credentials
        
    -   Token’s that have access to Customer’s GitHub organizations
        
    -   Access to another system that would lead to gaining access to GitHub e.g. Vault
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Social engineering, tools to steal sessions, secret scanning tools run against source code repositories, unintentional leaks through video walkthroughs or documentation, leaked dumps of databases and other systems on the black market and generally exposed secrets
        
    -   A customer’s employee unintentionally submitting a change
        
    -   A misconfiguration issue within the repository or a security setting has not been applied
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-4)

1.  Access Controls
    
    -   Role-Based Access: Assigning roles and permissions to users based on their responsibilities. Only authorized personnel should have elevated privileges (admin, maintain, write) to repositories while others may have read-only access in most cases.
        
    -   Least Privilege: Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users only have access to the specific repositories and branches necessary for their tasks.
        
    -   User and Group Management: Regularly review and manage user accounts and groups ensuring access is done through groups only. Also to revoke access for teams who no longer require it.
        
    -   Outside Collaborators: Should never be added to a repository
        
    -   Audit Access: audit both non-MFA service accounts and Enterprise Apps that have access to repositories ensuring the conform least privilege.
        
2.  Branch Protection:
    
    -   Require a pull request before merging as to prevent arbitrary code changes where someone or a machine can push directly to a protected branch. The PR must undergo a code review by an employee (preferably 2) before being merged.
        
    -   Require approvals to prevent arbitrary commits reaching a protected branch and can prevent unintentional security vulnerability being introduced. Ideally this involved 3 people. 1 person to submit the PR and 2 people to review it.
        
    -   Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed to prevent a review approving a PR where the PR has been modified after the approval. The review will be dismissed and the PR will need re-approval.
        
    -   Require review from Code Owners: Sets ownership and accountability for files within the repository where a team will need to approve a PR against their files before code can be merged into a protected branch.
        
    -   Require approval of the most recent reviewable push: This protects against when a reviewer applies some suggestions to the code enabling them to approve and merge code without someone reviewing those changes.
        
    -   Prevent Allow force pushes
        
    -   Prevent Allow deletions
        
3.  Authentication:
    
    -   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require MFA for all users accessing source code repositories which adds an additional layer of security and makes it more difficult for threat actors to compromise user accounts.
        
    -   Trust Boundary Authentication: Use authentication mechanisms that reside within the customer’s trust boundary and avoid any that are outside the control of the customer’s Org.
        
    -   Non-MFA Service Accounts: Switch from using non-MFA service accounts to GitHub Apps which utilize authentication mechanisms within the customer’s Org trust boundary

### T-07 A threat actor compromises a customer’s GitHub repository[](#t-07-a-threat-actor-compromises-a-customers-github-repository)

The threat actor could gain elevated access (e.g. write or admin) or exploit a misconfiguration to comprise the repository

#### Analysis[](#analysis-6)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Could expose sensitive proprietary information, proprietary algorithms, internal tools, and/or confidential data. This could trigger severe financial, legal, and reputational consequences for the customer.
        
    -   Could lead to a failure of data integrity
        
    -   Could lead to disruption of software development
        
    -   Could lead to disruption, downtime for customers, and breaking SLAs for cloud production systems
        
2.  Targets
    
    -   Customer’s GitHub public and private repositories
        
    -   Customer’s ability to develop and release code
        
    -   Customer’s production systems on cloud e.g. Serverless
        
    -   Customer’s sessions or credentials
        
    -   Token’s that have access to customer’s GitHub organizations
        
    -   Access to another system that would lead to gaining access to GitHub e.g. Vault
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Social engineering, tools to steal sessions, secret scanning tools run against source code repositories, unintentional leaks through video walkthroughs or documentation, leaked dumps of databases and other systems on the black market and generally exposed secrets
        
    -   A misconfiguration issue within the repository or a security setting has not been applied
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-6)

-   Define a GitHub Security Best Practice Policy
    
-   Ensure every customer’s GitHub repository can adhere to the policy
    

1.  Access Controls and Permissions:
    
    -   Only authorized personnel should have the ability to modify visibility settings where strong access controls and permissions are set for all repositories.
        
    -   Role-based access controls should be in place following the principle of least privilege. Limit the number of individuals who can modify settings to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unintentional changes.
        
    -   Ensure modification of these setting is not possible through automation (at least in most cases) where a human always needs to confirm
        
2.  MFA & Fine-grained tokens:
    
    -   Require MFA for all access to repositories.
        
    -   In the case of bots and programmatically adjusting settings the use of fine-grained access tokens should be favored. For the majority of these cases they should not have access to adjust the visibility settings so if a token was exposed it can be revoked by the customer and the scope of the functionality it can perform is reduced.
        
3.  Monitor and Audit Settings:
    
    -   Monitor for changes and ensure alerts are in place for any changes to visibility settings.
        
    -   Have regular auditing in place against repository settings to ensure that the visibility of the repository has not changed.
        
4.  Incident Response Plan:
    
    -   Ensure teams are aware of the ways they can report a security incident
5.  Education and Training
    
    -   Ensure employees are educated in the many forms of social engineering
        
    -   How to securely configure a GitHub repository
        

### T-08 A threat actor exploits a misconfigured GitHub Workflow or Action[](#t-08-a-threat-actor-exploits-a-misconfigured-github-workflow-or-action)

A threat actor could exploit a script injection or echo out secrets

#### Analysis[](#analysis-7)

1.  Impact:
    
    -   Access secrets, deployment / release keys, SSH keys, PATs etc.
        
    -   Exfiltrate sensitive information like secrets and circumnavigate the secret redaction feature
        
    -   Access the GITHUB\_TOKEN
        
    -   Modify the contents of the repository through the GitHub API
        
    -   Possible cross-repository access
        
2.  Targets
    
    -   Customer’s GitHub public repositories that contain GitHub workflows
        
    -   Sensitive data or secrets within used within the workflow including the GITHUB\_TOKEN
        
    -   Another customer’s GitHub repository (possible if the GITHUB\_TOKEN from one repo has been given access to another repo)
        
    -   Commit malicious code by exploiting a race condition
        
3.  Attack Vectors
    
    -   Script injection
        
    -   Exploit race condition
        
    -   Through a 3rd-party Action
        
    -   Emerging threats against software supply chain
        

#### Mitigations[](#mitigations-7)

1.  Best Practice Documentation
    
    -   Create a set of best practices around GitHub Workflows & Actions
2.  SAST
    
    -   Employ security static analysis tools to run against Workflow code and alert on security issues
3.  Security Training
    
    -   Educate developers about security best practices when creating Workflows
4.  Incident Response Plan
    
    -   Ensure there is a response plan in place if a Workflow is compromised / reported by HackerOne
5.  Prevent Script Injection
    
    -   Threat input to the Workflow the same way as you would with an application - don’t trust user input
6.  Properly scope access
    
    -   Set default permission for GITHUB\_TOKEN
7.  Secrets
    
    -   Ensure secrets are being stored and used securely
        
    -   Have a secret management policy that is followed, creation, use, revoke, rotate, and delete
        
8.  Control Changes
    
    -   CODEOWNERS for the Workflow files
        
    -   Ensure a PR is required to change Workflows
        
    -   Ensure code reviews are in place when creating Workflows and using Actions within the Workflows
        
    -   The code reviews should take into account the best practices
        
9.  Race conditions
    
    -   Use pull\_request\_review which associates with a particular Git SHA When triggering a GitHub Workflow using a comment on a pull request
