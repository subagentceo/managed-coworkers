# modal.Retries

```python
class Retries(object)
```

Adds a retry policy to a Modal function.

**Usage**

```python
import modal
app = modal.App()

# Basic configuration.
# This sets a policy of max 4 retries with 1-second delay between failures.
@app.function(retries=4)
def f():
    pass


# Fixed-interval retries with 3-second delay between failures.
@app.function(
    retries=modal.Retries(
        max_retries=2,
        backoff_coefficient=1.0,
        initial_delay=3.0,
    )
)
def g():
    pass


# Exponential backoff, with retry delay doubling after each failure.
@app.function(
    retries=modal.Retries(
        max_retries=4,
        backoff_coefficient=2.0,
        initial_delay=1.0,
    )
)
def h():
    pass
```

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    *,
    # The maximum number of retries that can be made in the presence of failures.
    max_retries: int,
    # Coefficent controlling how much the retry delay increases each retry attempt.
    # A backoff coefficient of 1.0 creates fixed-delay where the delay period always equals the initial delay.
    backoff_coefficient: float = 2.0,
    # Number of seconds that must elapse before the first retry occurs.
    initial_delay: float = 1.0,
    # Maximum length of retry delay in seconds, preventing the delay from growing infinitely.
    max_delay: float = 60.0,
):
```

Construct a new retries policy, supporting exponential and fixed-interval delays via a backoff coefficient.
