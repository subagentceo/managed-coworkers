# Invoking deployed functions

Modal lets you take a function created by a
[deployment](/docs/guide/managing-deployments) and call it from other contexts.

There are two ways of invoking deployed functions. If the invoking client is
running Python, then the same
[Modal client library](https://pypi.org/project/modal/) used to write Modal code
can be used. HTTPS is used if the invoking client is not running Python and
therefore cannot import the Modal client library.

## Invoking with Python

Some use cases for Python invocation include:

* An existing Python web server (eg. Django, Flask) wants to invoke Modal
  functions.
* You have split your product or system into multiple Modal applications that
  deploy independently and call each other.

### Function lookup and invocation basics

Let's say you have a script `my_shared_app.py` and this script defines a Modal
app with a function that computes the square of a number:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("my-shared-app")


@app.function()
def square(x: int):
    return x ** 2
```

You can deploy this app to create a persistent deployment:

```
% modal deploy shared_app.py
✓ Initialized.
✓ Created objects.
├── 🔨 Created square.
├── 🔨 Mounted /Users/erikbern/modal/shared_app.py.
✓ App deployed! 🎉

View Deployment: https://modal.com/apps/erikbern/my-shared-app
```

Let's try to run this function from a different context. For instance, let's
fire up the Python interactive interpreter:

```bash
% python
Python 3.9.5 (default, May  4 2021, 03:29:30)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import modal
>>> f = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")
>>> f.remote(42)
1764
>>>
```

This works exactly the same as a regular modal `Function` object. For example,
you can `.map()` over functions invoked this way too:

```bash
>>> f = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")
>>> f.map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### Authentication

The Modal Python SDK will read the token from `~/.modal.toml` which typically is
created using `modal token new`.

Another method of providing the credentials is to set the environment variables
`MODAL_TOKEN_ID` and `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`. If you want to call a Modal function
from a context such as a web server, you can expose these environment variables
to the process.

#### Lookup of lifecycle functions

[Lifecycle functions](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) are defined on classes,
which you can look up in a different way. Consider this code:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("my-shared-app")


@app.cls()
class MyLifecycleClass:
    @modal.enter()
    def enter(self):
        self.var = "hello world"

    @modal.method()
    def foo(self):
        return self.var
```

Let's say you deploy this app. You can then call the function by doing this:

```bash
>>> cls = modal.Cls.from_name("my-shared-app", "MyLifecycleClass")
>>> obj = cls()  # You can pass any constructor arguments here
>>> obj.foo.remote()
'hello world'
```

### Asynchronous invocation

In certain contexts, a Modal client will need to trigger Modal functions without
waiting on the result. This is done by spawning functions and receiving a
[`FunctionCall`](/docs/reference/modal.FunctionCall) as a
handle to the triggered execution.

The following is an example of a Flask web server (running outside Modal) which
accepts model training jobs to be executed within Modal. Instead of the HTTP
POST request waiting on a training job to complete, which would be infeasible,
the relevant Modal function is spawned and the
[`FunctionCall`](/docs/reference/modal.FunctionCall)
object is stored for later polling of execution status.

```python
from uuid import uuid4
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)
pending_jobs = {}

...

@app.route("/jobs", methods = ["POST"])
def create_job():
    predict_fn = modal.Function.from_name("example", "train_model")
    job_id = str(uuid4())
    function_call = predict_fn.spawn(
        job_id=job_id,
        params=request.json,
    )
    pending_jobs[job_id] = function_call
    return {
        "job_id": job_id,
        "status": "pending",
    }
```

### Importing a Modal function between Modal apps

You can also import one function defined in an app from another app:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("another-app")

square = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")


@app.function()
def cube(x):
    return x * square.remote(x)


@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    assert cube.remote(42) == 74088
```

### Comparison with HTTPS

Compared with HTTPS invocation, Python invocation has the following benefits:

* Uses the Modal client library's built-in authentication.
  * Web Functions are public to the entire internet, whereas Function lookup
    is private to your workspace and authenticated via your Modal token.
* You can work with shared Modal Functions as if they are normal Python
  functions, which might be more convenient.

## Invoking with HTTPS

Any application that can make HTTPS requests can interact with deployed Modal
applications via [Web Functions](/docs/guide/webhooks). Note that
all deployed Web Functions have [a stable HTTPS
URL](/docs/guide/webhook-urls).

Some use cases for HTTPS invocation include:

* Calling Modal functions from a web browser client running JavaScript
* Calling Modal functions from backend services in languages we don't yet have
  official SDKs for (Java, Ruby, etc.)
* Calling Modal functions using UNIX tools (`curl`, `wget`)

However, if the client of your Modal deployment is running Python, JavaScript,
or Go, it's better to use the [Modal Python
SDK](https://pypi.org/project/modal/) or [Modal SDKs for JavaScript and
Go](/docs/guide/sdk-javascript-go) to invoke your Modal code.

For more detail on setting up functions for invocation over HTTP see the
[Web Functions guide](/docs/guide/webhooks).
