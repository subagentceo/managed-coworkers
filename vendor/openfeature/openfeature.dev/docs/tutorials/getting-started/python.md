# Getting Started with the OpenFeature Python SDK

## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature with Python. You'll learn how to:

-   Install the Python SDK
-   Install and configure a provider
-   Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

This walk-through assumes that:

-   You have a basic understanding of Python and Flask.
-   You have Flask 3.x and Python 3.10 or later.
-   You have Docker installed and running on the host system. The latest version of Docker can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

> **NOTE:** If you don't have docker installed, check the available options to install Flagd [here](https://flagd.dev/installation/).

## Walk-through[​](#walk-through "Direct link to Walk-through")

### Step 1: Create a minimal flask application[​](#step-1-create-a-minimal-flask-application "Direct link to Step 1: Create a minimal flask application")

To get started, create a new folder, bootstrap the project, and install the dependencies. This can be done by running the following commands.

```
mkdir openfeature-python-introcd openfeature-python-intropip install Flask
```

### Step 2: Create a Flask app[​](#step-2-create-a-flask-app "Direct link to Step 2: Create a Flask app")

Create a new file named `app.py` inside openfeature-python-intro directory and include the following code.

```
  from flask import Flask  app = Flask(__name__)  @app.route("/")  def index():      return "Flask Server"
```

### Step 3: Add the OpenFeature SDK[​](#step-3-add-the-openfeature-sdk "Direct link to Step 3: Add the OpenFeature SDK")

Let's install the OpenFeature SDK using the following commands.

```
pip install typing-extensionspip install openfeature-sdkpip install openfeature-provider-flagd
```

Update `app.py` to import the SDK.

```
  from openfeature import api  from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider
```

Once you've imported `OpenFeature`, a new client can be created using the `FlagdProvider`.

```
  api.set_provider(FlagdProvider())  client = api.get_client()
```

The client can now be used to get a feature flag value. In this case, we'll get a `boolean` value using the `welcome-message` [flag key](/specification/glossary#flag-key) and fallback value, which is returned if there's abnormal behavior using the `client.get_boolean_value()` method.

```
@app.route("/")def index():    show_welcome_message = client.get_boolean_value("welcome-message", False)    if show_welcome_message:        return "Flask + OpenFeature Server"    return "Flask Server"
```

### Step 4: Run the application[​](#step-4-run-the-application "Direct link to Step 4: Run the application")

Let's start the app and see it in action, use the final code below.

```
from flask import Flaskfrom openfeature import apifrom openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProviderapp = Flask(__name__)api.set_provider(FlagdProvider())client = api.get_client()@app.route("/")def index():    show_welcome_message = client.get_boolean_value("welcome-message", False)    if show_welcome_message:        return "Flask + OpenFeature Server"    return "Flask Server"
```

Run the following command to start the server.

```
flask run
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). If all goes as planned, you should see "Flask Server".

"Why I'm I seeing that value?", you may ask. Well, it's because a provider hasn't been configured yet. Without a provider to actually evaluate flags, OpenFeature will return the default value. In the next step, you'll learn how to add a provider.

> NOTE: You should stop the app by using the keyboard short `ctrl + c` before moving on to the next step.

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)[​](#step-5-configure-a-provider-flagd "Direct link to Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)")

Providers are an important concept in OpenFeature because they are responsible for the flag evaluation itself. As we saw in the previous step, OpenFeature without a provider always returns the default value. If we want to actually perform feature flagging, we'll need to register a provider.

Create a new file named `flags.flagd.json` and add the following JSON. Notice that there's a flag called `welcome-message` which matches the flag key referenced earlier. The `welcome-message` flag has `on` and `off` variants that return `true` and `false` respectively. The state property controls whether the feature flag is active or not. Finally, the defaultVariant property controls the variant that should be returned. In this case, the defaultVariant is `off`, therefore the value `false` would be returned.

```
{  "flags": {    "welcome-message": {      "variants": {        "on": true,        "off": false      },      "state": "ENABLED",      "defaultVariant": "off"    }  }}
```

> NOTE: This configuration is specific for flagd and varies across providers.

With the flagd configuration in place, start flagd service with the following docker command.

> NOTE: On Windows WSL is required both for running docker and to store the file. This is a limitation of Docker ([https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8479](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8479))

```
docker run -p 8013:8013 -v $(pwd)/:/etc/flagd/ -it ghcr.io/open-feature/flagd:latest start --uri file:/etc/flagd/flags.flagd.json
```

Flagd can be run as a [standalone binary](https://flagd.dev/reference/flagd-cli/flagd/) or [Kubernetes Operator](https://openfeature.dev/docs/tutorials/ofo/) as well. If you don't have docker installed, get and install the [Flagd binary](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd/releases). With the flagd configuration in place, start flagd service with the following command.

```
flagd start -f file:flags.flagd.json
```

### Step 6: Rerun the application[​](#step-6-rerun-the-application "Direct link to Step 6: Rerun the application")

Now that everything is in place, let's start the app again.

```
flask run
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) should show the same value as before. This difference is now the feature flag value can be changed at runtime!

Let's change the feature flag in our `flags.flagd.json`, making `defaultVariant` to `on`

```
{  "flags": {    "welcome-message": {      "variants": {        "on": true,        "off": false      },      "state": "ENABLED",      "defaultVariant": "off"      "defaultVariant": "on"    }  }}
```

Save the changes to `flags.flagd.json` and refresh the browser tab. You should now be greeted with `Flask + OpenFeature Server`.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature Python SDK. It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature flagging concepts. It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a redeployment.
