# [](#osv-reporter)OSV-Reporter

Experimental

OSV-Reporter can be used to perform some experimental operations on the OSV-Scanner output JSON.

## [](#features)Features

-   Create a diff between two osv-scanner.json outputs, so you can see only new vulnerabilities.

```
$ osv-reporter --old previous-osv-scanner.json --new current-osv-scanner.json
```

-   Output multiple different formats from a single set of scan results.

```
$ osv-reporter --new osv-scanner.json --output-files=[format]:[output-path],[format2]:[output-path2]
```

## [](#how-to-install)How to install

We don’t provide prebuilt binaries for osv-reporter as it is very experimental and can change at any point.

Currently you can install it from source via `go install`:

```
$ go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/v2/cmd/osv-reporter@latest
# Or @main for the latest commit
```
