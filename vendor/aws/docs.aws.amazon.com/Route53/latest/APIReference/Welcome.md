Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 performs four main functions:
+ **Domain registration** – Route 53 helps lets you register domain names such as example.com.
+ **Domain Name System (DNS) service** – Route 53 translates friendly domains names like www.example.com into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1. Route 53 responds to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS servers, which reduces latency.
+ **Health checking** – Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to your application to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional.
+ **Resolver** – Route 53 Resolver lets you forward DNS queries from a VPC that you created using Amazon VPC to DNS resolvers in your network, and from your network to resolvers in your VPC. 

This *Amazon Route 53 API Reference* explains how to use API actions to create the following resources:

**Public and Private Hosted Zones**  
A *public hosted zone* is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains.   
A *private hosted zone* is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs that you created with the Amazon VPC service.  
See [Public and private hosted zones](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-public-private-hosted-zones).

**Reusable Delegation Sets**  
By default, each hosted zone that you create gets a different set of four name servers—a different delegation set. If you create a lot of hosted zones, maintaining different delegation sets can be difficult and time consuming. Route 53 lets you create a delegation set that you can reuse with multiple hosted zones. See [Reusable delegation sets](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-reusable-delegation-sets).

**Resource Record Sets**  
After you create a hosted zone for your domain, such as example.com, you create resource record sets to tell the Domain Name System (DNS) how to route traffic for that domain. See [Resource record sets](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-resource-record-sets).

**Traffic Policies and Traffic Policy Instances**  
You can create complex routing configurations, known as traffic policies, that use weighted, latency, failover, and geolocation resource record sets. You can then associate a traffic policy with a domain name or subdomain name, such as www.example.com, by creating a traffic policy instance. When users submit DNS queries for the domain or subdomain, Route 53 responds based on the traffic policy that you used to create the traffic policy instance. See [Traffic policies](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-traffic-policies) and [Traffic policy instances](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-traffic-policy-instances).

**Health Checks**  
Route 53 health checks monitor the health and performance of your web applications, web servers, and other resources. At regular intervals that you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the internet to your application, server, or other resource to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. See [Health checks](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-health-checks).

**Domain Registrations**  
When you want to get a new domain name, such as example.com, you can register it with Route 53. You can also transfer the registration for existing domains from other registrars to Route 53. See [Domain registration](API-actions-by-function.md#API-actions-by-function-domain-registration).

**DNS –DNSSEC**  
You can protect your domain from DNS spoofing or a man-in-the-middle attack, by configuring Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). See [DNS—DNSSEC](API-actions-by-function.md#API-actions-by-function-dnssec).

**Query Logs**  
You can configure Route 53 to log information about the DNS queries that Route 53 receives, such as the domain or subdomain that was requested, the date and time of the request, and the DNS record type (such as A or AAAA). See [Public DNS query logs](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-public-dns-query-logs).  
You can also configure Route 53 Resolver to log information about the DNS queries that originate in Amazon VPCs. See [Private DNS query logs](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-resolver-query-logs).

**Outbound and Inbound Endpoints, and Rules**  
You can configure Route 53 Resolver to forward DNS queries from your VPC to your network or vice versa. DNS queries pass through an outbound endpoint on their way from a VPC to your network, and they pass through an inbound endpoint on their way from your network to a VPC. For outbound queries, rules let you specify the domain names that you want to forward to your network and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers in your network. See [Route 53 Resolver endpoints](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-resolver-endpoints) and [Route 53 Resolver rules](API-actions-by-function.md#actions-by-function-resolver-rules).

**Tags**  
A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. You can use tags for a variety of purposes; one common use is to categorize and track your Route 53 costs. See [Tags](API-actions-by-function.md#API-actions-by-function-tags).

You can also use the Route 53 API to get the current limit on Route 53 objects that you can create, such as hosted zones and health checks. See [Limits (quotas) for accounts, hosted zones, and reusable delegation sets](API-actions-by-function.md#API-actions-by-function-limits).

In addition, the *Amazon Route 53 API Reference* includes the following information:
+ **Making API Requests** – How to submit HTTP requests to Route 53
+ **Traffic Policy Document Format** – Syntax and examples for the document that you include when you create a traffic policy programmatically
