## Overview

A **candidate** is an entity that FindAll discovers during the generation phase of a run. Each candidate represents a potential match that is evaluated against your match conditions.

### Candidate States

Candidates progress through these states during evaluation:

* **Generated**: Discovered from web data, queued for evaluation
* **Matched**: Successfully satisfied all match conditions
* **Unmatched**: Failed to satisfy one or more match conditions

<Note>
  **Post-Match Events**: When using [Streaming Events](/findall-api/features/findall-sse) or [Webhooks](/findall-api/features/findall-webhook), you may receive **`enriched`** events for matched candidates. These are event types (not `match_status` values) that indicate when additional data has been extracted via enrichments after a candidate has already matched.
</Note>

## Candidate Object Structure

Every candidate in FindAll results, SSE events, and webhook payloads follows this structure:

| Property       | Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `candidate_id` | string             | Unique identifier for the candidate                                                                                                                          |
| `name`         | string             | Name of the entity                                                                                                                                           |
| `url`          | string             | Primary URL for the entity                                                                                                                                   |
| `description`  | string             | Brief description of the entity                                                                                                                              |
| `match_status` | enum               | One of `generated`, `matched`, and `unmatched`                                                                                                               |
| `output`       | object             | Key-value pairs showing evaluation results for each match condition and enrichment (see section below for more details)                                      |
| `basis`        | array\[FieldBasis] | Citations, reasoning, and confidence scores for each field. See [FieldBasis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis#the-fieldbasis-object) for more details. |

### Understanding the `output` Field

The `output` field contains evaluation results where each key corresponds to a field name. Match conditions include an `is_matched` boolean, while enrichments do not:

```json theme={"system"}
{
  "founded_after_2020_check": {
    "value": "2021",
    "type": "match_condition",
    "is_matched": true // only match_condition contains boolean field is_match
  },
  "ceo_name": {
    "value": "Ramin Hasani",
    "type": "enrichment"
  }
}
```

### Understanding the `basis` Field

The `basis` field provides citations, reasoning, and confidence scores for each field in `output`.

<Note>
  **For complete details on basis structure and usage**, see [Access Research Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis).
</Note>

## Excluding Candidates

**Use case**: Excluding candidates is useful when you already know certain entities match your criteria (such as results from previous runs or entities you've already identified), allowing you to focus on discovering new matches. By excluding these known entities, you won't be charged for generating or evaluating them again, making your searches more cost-effective.

<Note>
  FindAll uses intelligence to deduplicate and disambiguate candidates you provide in the exclude list, which handles aliases and entities with slightly different names or URL variations. However, using the most official and disambiguated name and URL is recommended for best results.
</Note>

Provide an `exclude_list` to prevent specific entities from being generated or evaluated. Excluded entities won't incur evaluation costs or appear in results/events.

**Exclude list structure:** Array of objects with `name` (string) and `url` (string) fields.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL theme={"system"}
  curl -X POST "https://api.parallel.ai/v1beta/findall/runs" \
    -H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "objective": "FindAll portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures",
      "match_conditions": [...],
      "exclude_list": [
        {"name": "Figure AI", "url": "https://www.figure.ai"},
        {"name": "Anthropic", "url": "https://www.anthropic.com"}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python Python theme={"system"}
  from parallel import Parallel

  client = Parallel(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

  findall_run = client.beta.findall.create(
      objective="FindAll portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures",
      match_conditions=[...],
      exclude_list=[
          {"name": "Figure AI", "url": "https://www.figure.ai"},
          {"name": "Anthropic", "url": "https://www.anthropic.com"}
      ]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
  import Parallel from 'parallel-web';

  const client = new Parallel({
    apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL_API_KEY
  });

  const run = await client.beta.findall.create({
    objective: "FindAll portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures",
    match_conditions: [...],
    exclude_list: [
      { name: "Figure AI", url: "https://www.figure.ai" },
      { name: "Anthropic", url: "https://www.anthropic.com" }
    ]
  });

## Retrieving Candidates

Candidates can be accessed through multiple methods:

* **[`/result` endpoint](/findall-api/findall-quickstart#step-4-get-results)**: Retrieve all candidates (matched and unmatched) after run completion
* **[Streaming Events](/findall-api/features/findall-sse)**: Stream candidates in real-time as they're generated and evaluated
* **[Webhooks](/findall-api/features/findall-webhook)**: Receive HTTP callbacks for candidate events
