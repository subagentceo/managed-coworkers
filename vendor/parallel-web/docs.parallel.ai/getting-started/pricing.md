## Web Tools

### Search API

By default, the Search API returns 10 page results and their excerpts per request.

| Component                                    | Cost (\$/1000) |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Per 1,000 requests (default 10 results)      | 5              |
| Per 1,000 additional page results & excerpts | 1              |

**Cost formula:**

$$
\text{total cost} = 0.005 + (0.001 \times \text{additional results \& excerpts})
$$

### Extract API

| Component      | Cost (\$/1000) |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Per 1,000 URLs | 1              |

## Web Agents

### Chat API

Chat API pricing is based on the model you select. Research models (`lite`, `base`, `core`) are Chat API wrappers over [Task API processors](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor) and share the same pricing.

| Model   | Type               | Processor | Cost (\$/1000) |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| `speed` | Simple completions | -         | 5              |
| `lite`  | Research           | `lite`    | 5              |
| `base`  | Research           | `base`    | 10             |
| `core`  | Research           | `core`    | 25             |

### Task API

Task API pricing is based on the [processor](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor) you select. Cost is per 1,000 Task Runs. Fast processors have the same pricing as their standard counterparts.

<Note>
  Pricing is per Task Run (row), not per output field (cell). A single Task Run can populate many output fields—whether you request 1 field or 20 fields, the cost is the same.
</Note>

### FindAll API

FindAll API pricing is based on the [generator](/findall-api/core-concepts/findall-generator-pricing) you select, with a fixed cost plus a per-match cost.

| Generator | Fixed Cost | Per Match | Best For                                                  |
| --------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `preview` | \$0.10     | \$0.00    | Testing queries (\~10 candidates)                         |
| `base`    | \$0.25     | \$0.03    | Broad, common queries where you expect many matches       |
| `core`    | \$2.00     | \$0.15    | Specific queries with moderate expected matches           |
| `pro`     | \$10.00    | \$1.00    | Highly specific queries with rare or hard-to-find matches |

**Cost formula:**

$$
\text{total cost} = \text{fixed cost} + (\text{cost per match} \times \text{\# matches})
$$

If you add [enrichments](/findall-api/features/findall-enrich), each enrichment adds its own per-match cost based on the Task API processor you choose (see Task API pricing above).

### Monitor API

Monitor requests are priced per execution on a per-thousand (CPM) basis. Choose a processor based on query scope; both tiers deduplicate and reason over results.

| Processor | Cost (\$/1000) | Best for                                                 |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lite`    | 3              | Narrow queries — a single entity, domain, or signal type |
| `base`    | 10             | Wide queries — entity classes, topic areas, regions      |

**Cost formula:**

$$
\text{total cost} = \text{cost per 1,000} \times \text{number of executions} / 1000
$$
