[Elation Health](https://www.elationhealth.com) is a clinical electronic health record (EHR) and billing platform for primary care, with more than 46,000 clinical users caring for 24 million patients across 50 states. The company delivers AI-native solutions built for independent practices, direct primary care and concierge clinics, and primary-care-led enterprises.

## With Claude, Elation Health:

-   Reduced median time to first insight by 61% for chart review
-   Doubled usage of the product’s Clinical Insights feature after migrating to Claude
-   Simplified prompt engineering by removing workarounds needed for other model providers

## The problem

Primary care physicians face an administrative burden that cuts into patient time. Before each visit, clinicians must review dense, longitudinal patient charts—stitching together notes, labs, vitals, medications, and problem lists to reconstruct a patient's health story. For complex patients with multiple conditions managed over years, this chart prep consumed valuable time that could otherwise be spent on patient care.

Elation's Clinical Insights feature first launched in September 2025with another model provider, and already helped clinicians search and summarize chart data, but three challenges limited its effectiveness. Speed was the first barrier: the median time to first results was 26 seconds, too slow for tightly scheduled primary care visits. Trust was the second concern—clinicians needed summaries with clear citations back to source chart data so they could verify every statement at a glance. And the third requirement was fit for regulated healthcare workflows, where models must operate within HIPAA-compliant environments and strict governance frameworks.

“Clinical Insights was built to tackle the hardest part of chart review in primary care, pre-visit prep and in-visit review, when clinicians need instant clarity on what’s changed and why it matters,” said Kyna Fong CEO & Co-Founder of Elation Health. 

## Choosing Claude through rigorous evaluation

Elation selected Claude after evaluating it against real primary care workflows and concrete performance targets for chart intelligence inside the EHR. The decision came down to latency, reasoning quality, and safety.

"We chose Claude by Anthropic for the strength of its model and its reputation for responsible AI," said Fong. "That balance of performance plus trust was a decisive factor."

Claude also performed well at following complex instructions, essential for supporting physician decision-making while analyzing large amounts of clinical data..

“Claude delivers higher accuracy on chart-based evaluation tasks while operating at a fraction of the latency,” Fong shared. “Claude’s long‑context and instruction‑following performance was strong enough that we didn’t need to re‑engineer our pipeline or extensively rewrite prompts.” 

Implementation moved quickly. A small engineering group had Claude wired into internal builds in three days, using existing chart-search and Clinical Insights infrastructure. In several places, Claude's performance actually let the team simplify prompts and remove workaround logic they'd introduced for other model providers. Elation then rolled the Claude-backed version out to 100% of users over roughly two weeks without disrupting clinician workflows.

"Implementing Claude was a positive, high-leverage experience," the team noted. "In just 3 days of focused work, we significantly improved the speed and usability of an existing feature, then safely rolled the new experience out while staying true to our clinical-first, safety-conscious approach to AI in primary care."

## The outcome: Claude powers chart-aware clinical intelligence

Claude Haiku 4.5 now exclusively powers Clinical Insights, delivering cited, clinician-controlled summaries of a patient's health story directly within Elation's EHR. Before a visit, clinicians can click customizable buttons like "Summarize last three visits" or “search for a condition.” Claude synthesizes the most relevant information—recent assessments, treatment changes, lab trends, vitals, and follow-ups—into a concise summary with citations back to the underlying notes, labs, and problem list entries.

When Elation migrated Clinical Insights to Claude, the median time to start seeing insights dropped by 61%. Combined with streaming responses in the UI, clinicians can now begin reading answers as they generate, connecting the workflow more naturally to a live visit. 

The results show up in adoption and clinical workflow. Since Elation launched its clinical AI platform in August 2025, overall adoption of AI tools across the platform has more than tripled among active clinicians. Within that portfolio, Claude-powered Clinical Insights has emerged as the fastest-adopted AI feature, with usage doubling since the Claude migration and weekly prescriber usage steadily trending upwards.

Clinicians report that Clinical Insights helps "cut through the overload of EHR data" by quickly summarizing focused condition management, recent visits, abnormal results, and even suspected but undocumented conditions. Many use custom prompts to pull together clinical events, messages, new results, incomplete care plan items, open care gaps, and outside records into a single, explainable view.

Beyond Clinical Insights, Claude’s Opus 4.5 model is also improving how Elation builds and ships products. The company's engineers use Claude Code as a supported day-to-day coding assistant for refactors, test generation, and cross-repo changes, helping teams iterate faster while keeping existing review and safety practices in place.

Looking ahead, Elation is exploring how Claude can help reconcile external documents and historical data to keep charts complete with less manual effort. The team is also investigating how Claude can help triage and route inbox messages more efficiently, and is working to surface proactive insights across more parts of the EHR so clinicians can see relevant context without initiating a search each time.

"We see our relationship with Anthropic as a long-term, strategic partnership centered on bringing clinician-focused AI to primary care," said Fong. "Looking ahead, we expect to deepen collaboration around evaluation frameworks, domain-specific prompting patterns, and emerging model capabilities that can further reduce primary care burden."
