[Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/) provides product analytics and AI tools that help companies understand user behavior and act on it to drive product adoption. Over the past few months, the company has been building Novus, a product that detects and fixes usability issues in customer applications. The system runs on Claude's Agent SDK, deployed with Claude Managed Agents. We spoke with Zain Lakhani, Pendo's Chief AI Officer, about how Agent SDK powers their AI-native product. 

## What is Pendo building with Claude?

**Zain Lakhani, Pendo:** Our users used to be product managers looking at dashboards. Now they're product engineers shipping code. That changed everything about what we needed to build. Most of what we're building now is around detecting what's going on inside your application, then cross-referencing that with your codebase to suggest fixes. A sample use case: we see a drop-off in a funnel, look at the code, and say, "This button is positioned below the fold. There's a lot of drop-off here. Here's a fix." The underpinnings of all that are Claude's Agent SDK, deployed with Managed Agents.

## Tell me about Novus. What problem is it solving?

**Lakhani:** Product managers are becoming developers now. They're coding, they're shipping fast, and quite frankly, a lot of what's going out is difficult-to-use software that struggles to meet its adoption and retention goals. And it's not just PMs. Even developers using AI coding tools are shipping faster and doing so many multi-threaded tasks, four tickets at once, that a lot of code is hitting production without the user acceptance testing it would have received before. The velocity is there, but the feedback loop isn’t keeping up.

Novus is our answer to that. The idea is: you've shipped something, but you don't know what to ship next. You know something is broken, but you don't know what. Our approach isn't to slow anyone down. It’s: keep going fast and we'll fix it right after. Let's see how users are responding and try to optimize within minutes.

We're building this for what we call "product engineers." If we were building a tool from scratch for that persona, this is what it would look like.

## You tried building this before Managed Agents. What did that look like?

**Lakhani:** We learned pretty quickly that we're not a coding agent company. We don't want to be a coding agent company. The bulk of our intelligence, we want to offload onto a cloud agent and inject our own expertise: how do you instrument product analytics for a rapidly evolving product, what's the best way to use that data and what does good product usage look like. Then we lean on Claude's intelligence for the heavy lifting.

We spent about three months trying to get there on our own. We tried different homegrown solutions and it didn't work for us. Without Managed Agents, we were responsible for all the infrastructure around the agent itself. Session management, for example: sessions were stored on disc, and we had to locate them, retrieve them, upload them, and re-download them for every interaction. The shared memory layer required the same kind of manual work.

## How quickly did Managed Agents get you to production?

**Lakhani:** About three days. We'd been asking for the things Managed Agents provide. Session management, shared memory, sandboxing. Those were all gaps we had to fill ourselves before. Now every time we start a customer workflow, we spin up a Managed Agents session on the cloud. We don't route through our own infrastructure for the intelligence anymore. We go directly to Claude. We give it a copy of the customer's question, the intelligence insights, what we learned from past sessions, and we pair that with our Pendo data. Then it returns results.

Three days versus months of trying to build it ourselves.
