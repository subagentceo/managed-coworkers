[**Nevis**](https://www.neviswealth.com) is an AI platform for wealth management that helps financial advisors automate administrative tasks end-to-end. The company serves some of the fastest-growing wealth management firms in the US, supporting Registered Independent Advisors who collectively manage more than $50 billion in client assets.

## With Claude, Nevis Wealth:

-   Saves advisors 5+ hours per week on routine tasks, allowing them to potentially double their client capacity
-   Generates AI-powered meeting notes, follow-up tasks, and context-aware client emails automatically
-   Powers intelligent document search and analysis across client data and communications
-   Implemented production systems in days, with minimal engineering friction
-   Enables wealth management firms to scale operations while their teams focus on higher-value client service

## The problem

It’s estimated financial advisors today spend up to 80% of their time on administrative work. Client data is scattered across multiple, siloed, outdated technology systems. Advisors spend hundreds of hours pulling data from one platform to another, managing CRM entries, drafting follow-up emails, and documenting meeting notes. This slows advisors down, limits firm growth, and ultimately restricts access to expert financial advice for millions of families.

"Each of our advisors spends 1-2 hours each day managing data input into our CRM. Then each member of our ops team spends 2-3 hours each day inputting that information into our custodial platform," says Michael Dodds, President and Financial Advisor at Dodds Wealth. "Nevis is fixing that. It's a strategic step forward for our growth."

The founding team at Nevis saw this problem firsthand. Mark Swan (CEO), Philipp Burda (CPO), and Ivan Chalov (COO) were former executives at Revolut, where Burda led AI initiatives and observed the transformative potential for large language models to automate middle- and back-office operations in financial services. They left to build Nevis around a simple belief: AI will transform the part of financial services with the heaviest administrative burden and the greatest upside potential for automation.

## Why Nevis chose Claude for mission-critical operations

Nevis selected Opus 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 because the models consistently deliver the best combination of accuracy, speed, and reliability for financial services. In testing, Claude demonstrated materially lower hallucination rates and tighter adherence to complex, multi-step instructions than comparable models. Claude's ability to process entire meeting transcripts in a single request eliminated the error-prone chunking required with other models they evaluated. For a platform that handles sensitive client data and produces work that advisors rely on to manage millions of dollars, these qualities are non-negotiable.

"The type of work our AI agents perform requires a combination of strong logical reasoning capabilities and deep finance domain expertise," says Burda "Anthropic's models excel at both, so we were not surprised to see them outperform other models on our internal, tailor-made evaluations. We have developed and are using a targeted set of synthetic evaluation datasets that closely approximate financial advisers’ day-to-day tasks and processes. We use Claude models in our production agentic pipelines and are very satisfied with the quality of work they deliver for our users."

## Building an AI-first platform for wealth management

Claude powers several core workflows within the Nevis platform. AI Meeting Agents create transcripts, correct speech-to-text errors, and generate client meeting summaries and notes. Smart Tasks automatically creates complete task items with titles, subtasks, descriptions, and assignees. Smart Emails drafts context-aware communications that understand meeting history and adapt to each advisor's writing style.

Implementation was remarkably fast. Nevis had Claude powering real operations within days. The team uses Pydantic AI for their meeting intelligence products, which made integration straightforward. For search and document analysis, they work directly with the Anthropic API through the Python module.

The impact on day-to-day work is immediate. "Wrapping up a meeting at 7pm used to mean I'd not be home before 8pm, as my wife will testify," says a financial advisor at United Capital. "Now, I can close my laptop and know that Nevis has my back: all my notes are there, my to-do list is up to date and there's a recap email ready for me to review and send to my client."

Nevis is also an AI-first company internally. The team uses Claude Code for rapid code generation, refactoring, and first-pass PR reviews. Claude models power internal meeting intelligence, RAG-based search across documentation and customer call notes, product spec drafting, and customer call preparation. With quasi-no-code tools like n8n, Nevis is now empowering their operations team with the same Claude APIs that developers use.

## The outcome

Nevis expects the average advisor using the platform to save more than five hours per week. Over time, this should enable advisors to double the number of clients they can serve, going from 100 to more than 200 clients while maintaining the highest levels of service. For wealth management firms, this translates to the ability to grow assets under management while their operations teams focus on higher-value client service rather than routine data entry.

"We expect Nevis to eliminate thousands of hours of manual work across the firm," says Dave Breslin, Executive Vice President at GC Wealth. "That will free up advisors to spend more time with clients and less time on routine operational tasks."

Nevis's implementation demonstrates that AI can address wealth management's fundamental capacity challenge by eliminating the administrative burden that prevents advisors from doing what they do best. Their approach of starting with back-office automation and progressively moving toward client-facing applications offers a practical roadmap for firms navigating AI adoption.

Looking ahead, Nevis plans to bring AI closer to their end clients. The company started with back-office applications and has moved to the middle-office, where advisors and relationship managers interact with AI-powered tools for internal purposes. As they continue this journey, Nevis may soon expose end consumers to AI-powered experiences directly.

"As we scale, we expect Claude to power an increasing share of our platform, from meeting intelligence to agentic processes," says Swan. "We see Claude powering some of our most advanced AI agents, enabling fully autonomous operational pipelines that support thousands of financial advisors across the US."
