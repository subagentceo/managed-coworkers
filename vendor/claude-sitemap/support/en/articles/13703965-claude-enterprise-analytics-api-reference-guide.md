## Overview

The Claude Enterprise Analytics API gives your organization programmatic access to engagement, adoption, usage, and cost data across Claude surfaces within your Enterprise organization. Whether you're building internal dashboards for user activity, tracking adoption of projects, reconciling spend against your monthly bill, or informing spend limits, this API provides the metrics you need.

## Data aggregation

All data is aggregated **per organization, per day**. Each endpoint returns a snapshot for a single date that you specify. **Data for day (N-1) is run at 10:00:00 UTC time on day N**, and is available for querying three days after aggregation, to ensure accuracy of data.

If data is not available within the timeline above, this usually indicates a data pipeline failure that our team will need to investigate internally. We are usually aware of such problems, but please raise this to your CSM if you want a gut check, or suspect something else.

The cost and usage endpoints have a different freshness model. See **[Cost and usage endpoints](#h_1206b7d42a)** below for details.

## Enabling access

In order to mint new analytics API keys, you must be a Primary Owner within your Enterprise organization. You can do so by navigating to **[claude.ai/analytics/api-keys](http://claude.ai/analytics/api-keys)**.

Some more details that might be helpful:

- You can *enable/disable* access to the public API anytime. If you disable access by toggling the switch off, all requests will be denied.

- You’ll need a key with the `read:analytics` scope in order to access the API. You can create multiple keys for your organization, but rate limits apply at the *organization* level, not the *key* level. See the “Rate limiting” section below.

- As always, *we strongly recommend handling API keys securely*: *never* share these keys publicly - they are secret, and should be shared securely.

## Base URL

All requests are sent to:

```
https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/analytics/
```

## Authentication

Every request requires an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header. Your API key must have the `read:analytics` scope. You can create and manage API keys from the claude.ai admin settings under the API Keys section.

**Example request headers:**

```
x-api-key: $YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Pagination

Several endpoints return paginated results. Pagination uses a cursor-based approach, where the response includes a `next_page` token you pass back in your next request to retrieve the following page of results.

Two optional parameters control pagination:

**limit** (integer): Number of records per page. Defaults to 20 for the /users endpoint and 100 for all other endpoints. For cost and usage endpoints, defaults vary by endpoint and bucket width — see **[Cost and usage endpoints](#h_1206b7d42a)** below. The maximum is 1000.

**page** (string): The opaque cursor token from the previous response's `next_page` field. Omit this on your first request.

When there are no more results, `next_page` will be `null` in the response.

**Important:** Do not change query parameters mid-sequence on cost and usage endpoints. Cursors are bound to the filters and date range that issued them. If you change products[], order_by, group_by[], the date range, or any filter and pass an old cursor, you'll get a 400 error.

## Error responses

All endpoints return standard HTTP error codes:

| **Code** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | A query parameter is invalid. Common causes include an invalid date, a date before 1/1/26 (first availability), a date that is today or in the future, or (on cost and usage endpoints) a page cursor that doesn't match current query parameters. |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key (cost and usage endpoints). |
| 404 | The API key is missing, invalid, or does not have the `read:analytics` scope. |
| 410 | The page cursor is no longer valid. Restart pagination from the first page. |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded. Too many requests. |
| 500 | Internal error (cost and usage endpoints). |
| 504 | Request timed out. |

## Rate limiting

We do have default rate limits in place that apply across all endpoints in this API. If that isn’t sufficient for your use case, we’d love to understand why. If necessary, we can adjust the rate limits for your organization—please reach out to your CSM.

### 2. Activity summary

`GET /v1/organizations/analytics/summaries`

Returns a high-level summary of engagement and seat utilization **per-day** for your organization for a given date range. The response is a list of days with aggregated counts within the date range. Note that the maximum difference between `ending_date` and `starting_date` must be **31 days**, and there is a three-day delay in data availability. This is useful for tracking daily active users, weekly and monthly trends, and seat allocation at a glance.

**We define “active”** if any one of the following is true:

- The user sent at least one chat message on Claude (chat).

- The user had at least one Claude Code (local or remote) session associated with the C4E org, with tool use/git activity

- The user had at least one Claude Cowork session with tool use or message activity.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `starting_date` | string | Yes | The starting date to retrieve data for, in YYYY-MM-DD format. There is a three-day delay in data availability, so the most recent data you can access is from three days ago. |
| `ending_date` | string | No | The optional ending date to retrieve data for, in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is *exclusive*. |

**Response fields**

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |

**Note:** The rolling windows for weekly and monthly counts look backward from the specified date (inclusive). If data is incomplete for some days within the window (for example, if the date is less than 30 days in the past), the monthly count may undercount activity.

**Example request**

```
curl -X GET "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/analytics/summaries?starting_date=2025-01-01"
   --header "x-api-key: $YOUR_API_KEY"

## Cost and usage endpoints

**Note:** Cost and usage endpoints apply to usage-based Enterprise plans. For seat-based Enterprise plans, these endpoints will reflect extra usage only.

The cost and usage endpoints (available now in beta) give your organization programmatic access to token and USD cost data for Claude (chat), Claude Code, Cowork, Office Agent, and Claude in Chrome.

There are four endpoints in two shapes:

| **Shape** | **Endpoints** | **Returns** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Per-user** (one row per user, sorted) | user_usage_report, user_cost_report | Users ranked by tokens or spend across a date range. |
| **Bucketed** (one row per time bucket, optionally grouped) | usage_report, cost_report | Usage or cost over time, broken down by product, model, or other dimensions. |

Use the **per-user** endpoints to answer "who are my top spenders?" Use the **bucketed** endpoints to answer "how is usage trending day over day, broken down by product?"

### Data freshness and finality

Data is typically available within four hours of the underlying usage, but may take up to 24 hours. Each response includes a data_refreshed_at timestamp indicating the export the response was served from; usage that occurred after that watermark is not yet reflected.

Values for a given date may be revised for up to 30 days as late events arrive and reconciliation runs. For invoicing-grade totals, query dates at least 30 days in the past.

When ending_at is omitted (the default is "now"), the response will include a tail of data **after** data_refreshed_at that is incomplete. For stable results across repeated calls, set ending_at to a value at or before a previously returned data_refreshed_at.

### Date range limits

starting_at may be up to **365 days** in the past, and a single query may span **at most 31 days** (ending_at - starting_at). To cover a longer period, issue multiple queries with adjacent windows. **No data is available prior to** **2026-01-01**.

### Pagination

All four cost and usage endpoints are paginated with an opaque cursor. The first request returns up to limit rows plus a next_page cursor; pass that cursor unchanged as the page parameter on the next request, and repeat until has_more is false.

Treat next_page as opaque: pass it back unchanged on the next request and send the same query parameters on every page. If a request returns 400 or 410 with a message about the page cursor, discard it and start again from the first page.

**Do not change query parameters mid-sequence.** Cursors are bound to the filters and date range that issued them. If you change products[], order_by, group_by[], the date range, or any filter and pass an old cursor, you'll get a 400 error.

### Serializing list parameters

List parameters use bracket notation: repeat the parameter name with [] for each value.

`products[]=chat&products[]=claude_code`

### The Actor object

Each per-user result row identifies the user who generated the usage.

```
{
  "type": "user_actor",
  "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGh",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com"

| data[].cost_type | When group_by[] includes cost_type: one of tokens, web_search, code_execution. null when not set. |
| data[].token_type | When group_by[] includes token_type: one of uncached_input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens, cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens, cache_creation.ephemeral_1h_input_tokens. Only non-null on rows where cost_type is tokens. |
| data[].requests | Number of API requests |
| has_more | Whether another page exists. |
| next_page | Opaque cursor for the next page. |

**Parsing amounts**

amount and list_amount are decimal strings denominated in cents. "41280.000000" represents 41,280 cents (US $412.80). To convert to dollars, parse as a decimal and divide by 100. Avoid binary floating-point parsing for values that may exceed several million dollars.

**Example request**

```
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/analytics/user_cost_report?starting_at=2026-03-01T00:00:00Z&order_by=amount&limit=20" \

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| starting_at | RFC 3339 datetime | Yes | — | Start of range, inclusive. Must be within the last 365 days. Floored to the nearest bucket_width boundary in UTC. |
| ending_at | RFC 3339 datetime | No | now | End of range, exclusive. The range may span at most 31 days. Floored to the nearest bucket_width boundary in UTC. |
| bucket_width | 1m, 1h, 1d | No | 1d | Time bucket granularity: minute, hour, or day. |
| group_by[] | one or more of product, model, context_window, inference_geo, speed | No | none | Dimensions to break down within each bucket. Omit for a single aggregate per bucket. |
| products[] | one or more of chat, claude_code, cowork, office_agent, claude_in_chrome,claude_design | No | all | Filter to specific product surfaces. |
| models[] | string, max 100 entries | No | all | Filter to specific model names. |
| context_windows[] | one or more of 0-200k, 200k-1M | No | all | Filter to specific context-window pricing tiers. Use group_by[]=context_window to break out per-tier values. |
| inference_geos[] | one or more of global, us, not_available | No | all | Filter to specific inference regions. not_available matches rows where the region is unset. Use group_by[]=inference_geo to break out per-region values. |
| speeds[] | one or more of fast, standard | No | all | Filter to fast or standard inference mode. |
| user_ids[] | string, max 100 entries | No | all | Filter to specific users. |
| limit | integer | No | varies | Buckets per page. Default and maximum vary by bucket_width: 1d → 7 (max 31); 1h → 24 (max 168); 1m → 60 (max 256). |
