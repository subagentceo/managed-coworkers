Traditionally, building AI applications has required a lot — managing API keys, stressing about costs, handling complex deployments, accidentally hitting rate limits, and more. With Claude’s artifacts, you can skip the hassle of configuration and build a fully functional, AI-powered application with Claude’s intelligence built right in. These artifacts use your existing usage limits—no API keys, no per-call charges, no deployment hassle — so you can focus on the fun stuff.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to rapidly build, test, and share AI-powered applications using Claude.

## Configuring a Claude API inside Claude artifacts

Using a limited text-based completion inside [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) artifacts is quite simple.  

1.  You can add AI capabilities to your artifact by simply **asking** Claude to use Claude, with additional instructions as needed.
2.  Optionally, test that it’s working as expected with the sample prompt below.

Use this simple prompt to test that the API embedded in the artifact is working as expected:

Create a simple chatbot that uses Claude. Respond with compliments to every user input.

What you’ll see if you try this prompt, is that Claude will create a “compliment bot” where users can input anything and receive LLM-powered compliments in return!

## Inspiration for your first AI artifact

The possibilities for creating artifacts that interact with Claude through an API are as endless as your imagination. Here’s four types of apps you could build to get started:

-   **Learning & education tools** — Interactive tutors and study companions with AI can better understand the context of a user’s learning needs. Like a code reviewer that gives detailed feedback on style and best practices based on pre-configured guidelines, or this [language tutor](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/2af221b6-367f-4b4f-9fe9-25710f5f8feb) that lets you chat and learn in a language of your choice.

-   **Content generation tools** — Collaborative assistants that help brainstorm, develop, and refine creative work and content according to some pre-configured guidelines can help you get work done faster. Like a writing tool designed to intake your internal slack posts and get them ready to share on LinkedIn, or this [one-page PRD maker](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/3d81ba29-d1ad-4e9b-b58e-3e0f46ba8afd).

-   **Analysis & decision support** \- Intelligent tools that process user data and help make informed decisions through conversation are great for organizational efficiency. Like [this tool](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/fc64414e-76db-4876-8531-6e9794e4b1be) designed to help teams get to the root of problems through the “5 whys” framework.

-   **Apps for fun —** at the end of the day, the best apps are derived from a unique perspective and good idea. This [dream interpreter](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/be6430eb-3710-447c-a8b6-da40792ed790) is a perfect example. If you can dream it, you can probably build it.

## Tips for building artifacts with Claude

As you build with Claude, consider the following tips to get the best possible output.

-   **Let Claude interview you**: Consider starting your conversation with an idea and letting Claude interview you to refine it into an artifact-worthy prompt. Claude can ask you questions and suggest features to make your vision a reality.

-   **Iterate with follow-up prompts**: Simply ask Claude to modify your artifact as needed. You can ask things like: make the buttons bigger, respond in less than 200 words each time, change the color scheme, and so on. Each request builds on previous versions while Claude maintains context about what you've built and why.

-   **Debug through conversation**: When something breaks, either click "Fix with Claude" or describe the problem in plain language ("the calculator isn't working with decimals," "the game crashes at level 3"). No need to understand technical error messages.

**Experiment with forking**: Go back to any previous message, click "Edit" to create a new conversation branch, and try different approaches. You can always return to your original version, encouraging bold experimentation with styles, features, or entirely different directions.

## Sharing your Claude artifacts

Another benefit to prototyping with artifacts is that you can share your ideas without having to host them externally.

### Share your prototype with just a few clicks

All you need to do is click the “Publish” button in the top right hand corner of the artifact menu and distribute the link.

Note that this link is specific to the version of the artifact you shared, and that **anyone with this link can access** your creation until you unpublish it. (You can always come back to the “published” tab to see all artifacts you’ve previously shared.)

### Moving from prototype to production

While artifacts are excellent for prototyping and sharing AI-powered apps, they're best for testing and demonstration. At some point, you'll likely want to implement proper API key management and build more robust infrastructure. Eventually, you’ll also run up against a few technical limitations in [claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) (like the lack of interleaved scripts).

Whatever the reason, when you’re ready to take your artifact to the next level, you’ll be able to copy Claude’s code and paste it into your editor of choice. From there, [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) is ready to step in.

As you build, keep working with Claude as a brainstorming partner for next-steps and new ideas, using Claude Code for tactical execution. Before you know it, you’ll have a fully validated, production-ready app.

## FAQs

### What are artifacts and why use them for prototyping?

[Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them) are self-contained pieces of code that Claude creates during conversations. They appear in a dedicated panel next to the chat, making them easy to view, edit, and interact with in real-time. Plus, they can be shared to the world in just a few clicks.

For AI app prototyping, artifacts offer a few key advantages to traditional development flows.

-   **Instant feedback** — Test working code immediately as Claude generates it

-   **Rapid iteration** — Request changes based on your testing in real-time

-   **Built-in AI capabilities** — Add Claude API calls without additional costs or setup

### Can I collaborate on artifacts with friends or teammates?

When someone with a Claude account clicks your shared link, they can customize and modify the artifact by talking to Claude. When they do so, they create their own copy rather than editing your original—so your version stays exactly as you made it while they develop their own variation. Great for quick iteration and record-keeping of past app ideas.

### What kinds of usage limits exist for AI in artifacts?

Whoever uses your app incurs usage on their plan. In other words, when you're building and testing the API usage counts against your plan, but when others use your shared app, the usage is on their plan instead.

In simplest terms, when someone uses your Claude-powered app:

-   They authenticate with their existing Claude account

-   Their API usage counts against _their_ subscription, not yours

-   You pay nothing for their usage

-   No one needs to manage API keys
