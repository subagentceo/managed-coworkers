## Phase 1: Technical Setup

**Complete these technical configuration steps before launching Claude to your organization.**

### Authentication & Access

**Follow these steps to configure SSO:**

Claude Enterprise supports SAML 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect) for single sign-on (SSO). See [Setting Up SSO](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13132885-setting-up-single-sign-on-sso) for detailed configuration steps.

1.  **Test SSO:** Configure with a small pilot group before broad rollout.
2.  **Enable domain capture:** Automatically route users from your domain to your workspace. See [Domain Capture Setup](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10276682-important-considerations-before-enabling-single-sign-on-sso-and-jit-scim-provisioning).
3.  **Enforce SSO:** Require SSO for all access once configuration is validated.

### User Provisioning Options

Choose your provisioning method based on your organization's needs. See [User Provisioning Overview](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13133195-setting-up-jit-or-scim-provisioning) for setup instructions.

1.  **SCIM (recommended):** System for Cross-domain Identity Management enables automatic sync from your identity provider (IdP). See [SCIM Setup Guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13133195-setting-up-jit-or-scim-provisioning).
2.  **Just-in-Time (JIT):** Users are created upon first SSO login. Simple to set up but offers less control over access.
3.  **Manual:** Admin-managed invitations via the [Admin Console](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13133750-managing-members-on-team-and-enterprise-plans). Best for small, controlled pilots.

> **Example: Phased Rollout with SCIM**
> 
> Many organizations use SCIM for a phased rollout approach:
> 
> 1.  Start with a pilot group of 50-100 users synced via SCIM
> 2.  Monitor adoption and gather feedback for 2–4 weeks
> 3.  Gradually expand SCIM groups to include additional departments
> 4.  Enable organization-wide access once processes are established

### Security & Compliance

Claude Enterprise includes robust security and compliance features designed for enterprise environments:

Review security details at the [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com) and in the [Enterprise Plan Overview](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797531-what-is-the-enterprise-plan).

1.  **Data retention:** Conversations are retained per your policy and exportable via the [Compliance API](https://trust.anthropic.com/) and [Audit Logs](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9970975-how-to-access-audit-logs), which also provide full activity logging for security monitoring.
2.  **No model training:** Your organization's data is not used to train Claude models by default.
3.  **Role-based access:** Primary Owner, Owner, and Member roles provide granular permissions. See [Member Roles Guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9267276-roles-and-permissions).

#### User Authentication for Claude Code

Share the following steps with end users to connect Claude Code to their enterprise account:

-   **Install Claude Code:** Run the command below that corresponds to your operating system to install Claude Code.
    -   **macOS / Linux / WSL:** `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
    -   **Windows (PowerShell):** `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
-   **Start Claude Code:** Type "claude" in your terminal.
-   **Select login method:** Choose "Claude account with subscription".
-   **Authenticate via Enterprise SSO** with your corporate credentials.
-   **Your seat subscription will be linked to Claude Code** automatically upon successful authentication.

> **Troubleshooting**
> 
> -   If already logged in via a different account, run `/logout` first, then `/login`
> -   Run "claude update" if not seeing the enterprise auth option
>     -   Restart terminal after updates
>     -   Console API key users switching to access via Claude Enterprise seats: Run `/logout`, then `/login` and select "Claude account with subscription"

#### Admin Monitoring for Claude Code

Monitor and manage Claude Code usage across your organization:

-   Navigate to Analytics > Claude Code to view usage analytics
-   Monitor usage across all surfaces (Claude.ai + Claude Code)

> **Important**
> 
> Claude Code access requires a Premium seat (legacy model), or a Chat + Code or Claude Enterprise seat (usage-based model). Standard and Chat-only seats do NOT include Claude Code access.
> 
> For organizations migrating from Console/API-based Claude Code access, users must re-authenticate via Enterprise SSO to link their subscription.

## Phase 2: Change Management & Launch

### Identify & Enable Champions

Champions are enthusiastic early adopters who can help drive adoption across their teams:

-   Select 2–3 champions per department or team
-   Provide champions with early access and advanced training
-   Equip champions with talking points and demo guidance
-   Create a champions Slack channel or Teams group for peer support
-   Recognize and reward champion contributions to adoption

### Launch Communications

Plan a multi-channel communication strategy for your launch:

-   **Pre-Launch (2 weeks before):** Communications highlighting benefits and use cases
-   **Launch Day:** Executive announcement, getting started guide, training schedule
-   **Post-Launch (Week 1):** Tips and tricks, success stories from pilot users
-   **Ongoing:** Weekly tips, monthly newsletters, quarterly business reviews

## Phase 3: Enablement & Training

Provide comprehensive training resources to help users get the most from Claude.

### Structured Training Programs

Deploying Claude is a technical milestone, but adoption depends on whether people know how to use it effectively. A structured training program ensures users move past initial curiosity into productive, habitual use — and reduces the support burden on your IT and champion teams.

-   **All-Staff 101 Sessions:** Workshops (30–60 min) covering the basics — navigating the interface, writing effective prompts, and using core features like Projects and Artifacts. Run at launch and repeat for new hire cohorts.
-   **Department-Level Enablement:** Targeted sessions built around each team's actual workflows, with an executive sponsor to signal leadership support. Partner with team leads to identify high-value use cases and provide ready-to-use prompt templates. Schedule a follow-up 2–4 weeks later to address questions from real usage.
-   **Office Hours:** Weekly or biweekly drop-in sessions where users bring real work and get hands-on help from champions. Especially valuable in the first 30–60 days.
-   **LMS Integration:** If your organization uses an LMS, package Claude training into trackable courses to monitor enablement coverage and tie completion to access or feature rollout milestones.

### Internal Support Channels

Establish ongoing support infrastructure for your Claude users:

-   Dedicated Slack/Teams channel for Claude questions and tips
-   Weekly office hours with champions or power users
-   IT helpdesk integration for access and technical issues
-   Monthly user group meetings to share best practices
-   Dedicated Claude Code support channel for developer-specific questions

## Phase 4: Scaling Adoption

After initial deployment, focus on expanding usage, building internal ownership, and demonstrating sustained value across the organization.

### Expanding Across Teams

Prioritize teams with strong use case fit and willing champions. For each new team:

-   Conduct a brief needs assessment to identify high-value workflows
-   Provision seats (including Claude Code for developer teams) and deliver tailored onboarding
-   Appoint a local champion to drive adoption and share early wins across the organization

### Measuring Impact

Shift from tracking activity metrics to demonstrating business value. Focus on outcomes that matter to leadership:

-   Track adoption (active users, department penetration, feature usage) via the Admin dashboards and API
-   Measure productivity gains (hours saved, tasks augmented) through periodic user surveys
-   Pair quantitative data with qualitative examples – short case studies from team leads illustrating real impact
-   Establish a regular reporting cadence (e.g., quarterly business reviews) to keep stakeholders informed

### Feature Rollout & Governance

Introduce advanced capabilities gradually so teams can build confidence without feeling overwhelmed. A natural progression might move from core features (Projects, Artifacts, Connectors) to intelligence features (Enterprise Search, Research) to integrations (Claude Code, Skills) and finally to automation (Cowork, custom connectors).

As usage grows, revisit your governance posture:

-   Review data retention policies, audit log cadences, and project visibility defaults
-   Maintain an allowlist of approved connectors and extensions, routing new requests through your standard IT governance process
-   Configure usage guardrails to manage consumption as the user base expands

### Sustaining Momentum

Long-term success depends on building internal ownership and feedback loops:

-   Designate a program owner and consider forming a lightweight Center of Excellence to curate prompts, Skills, and playbooks
-   Run periodic user surveys, champion roundtables, and usage analytics reviews to surface what's working and what needs attention
-   Refresh training materials quarterly to reflect new features and lessons learned
-   Incorporate Claude onboarding into your standard new hire orientation
-   At each phase of rollout, consider a brief retrospective:
    -   What use cases emerged?
    -   What barriers remain?
    -   What should change for the next phase?
