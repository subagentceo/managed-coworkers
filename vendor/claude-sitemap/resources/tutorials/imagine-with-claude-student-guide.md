Some things land faster drawn than said, and a good teacher knows when to reach for the whiteboard.

Now, Claude can do that too. When a visual is the clearer answer to what you asked, Claude builds one as part of its response. The visual sits alongside the text, shaped directly to your ask — a diagram you click into as Claude explains, a chart you filter while you ask follow-ups, something that plays when the concept is a sound.

The visual streams in alongside the text and the conversation keeps going. You can adjust it, click into what's still unclear, or ask a follow-up and Claude draws the next one. If something turns out worth keeping, there's a one-click path to save it for later.

**You don't need to do anything special.** Claude decides when a visual would help. You can also ask to explicitly trigger it — any version of "draw this," "show me," or "can I see that" works.

### What this is, practically

-   **Appears as part of Claude's answer** — in the flow of the conversation, not a side panel. If you've used [Artifacts](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them), this is the lighter version.
-   **Interactive, often.** Sliders, draggable points, buttons, interactive elements, and even sound.
-   **Built from what you gave it** — can use context from the conversation, files you uploaded, or what Claude knows about you.
-   **Diagrams, charts, tools** — not image generation.
-   **Web and desktop**, all plans while in beta.

## A few moments where this may help you

Here's what it looks like in practice — the prompt, the response, and the visual appearing mid-answer.

### Seeing the explanation drawn out

A concept from lecture, a dense passage from a textbook, a thing you keep hearing about but can't picture— drawn so you can see what it actually means.  
‍

Imagine embed — turkish

Turkish is supposedly agglutinative — suffixes stack up. I get that in principle but I can't picture how one word ends up meaning a whole sentence. Build me an example step by step so I can see each piece doing its job.

Here's one word — _görüşemeyecekmişiz_ — that means "apparently we won't be able to see each other." It's one word because Turkish adds each grammatical piece as its own suffix, in a fixed slot, and the pieces don't fuse into each other the way English irregulars do.

Watch it build, one morpheme at a time. The root is _gör_, "see":

That's what "agglutinative" means in practice: each suffix does one job, the order is fixed, and the boundaries stay clean. Once you know the slots — reciprocal, ability, tense, evidentiality, person — you can read a word back off like a formula, and you can build new ones by filling the slots differently.

### Interacting with the concept in chat

Some things you need to hear, or change, or click. Claude builds the interactive version so you're doing, not just reading.

Imagine embed — color-mixing

Wait — red + green light makes yellow on a screen, but red + green paint makes brown. Why does mixing colors work completely differently depending on whether it's light or paint?

Short answer: **light adds, paint subtracts.** A screen stacks light on light — more mixing means more energy hitting your eye, trending toward white. Paint is a _filter_ — each pigment steals wavelengths, and stacking filters means _less_ light surviving to reach your eye.

  

Why brown, not black? → Why printers use CMYK →

The key is **what you're starting from.** A screen starts at black — every subpixel adds photons until you've got white. Paper starts at white — every pigment steals wavelengths until you're left with muddy brown, because real pigments aren't perfect filters.

### Visualizing how things connect

Some concepts are spatial — things connect, one number feeds into another. Text forces you to hold it all in your head. Claude draws the connections so you can trace them.

Imagine embed — cash-flow

I keep memorizing that depreciation gets added back on the cash flow statement, but I don't get why. Show me what's actually happening between net income and the operating section — I want to see the connection, not just the rule.

The cash flow statement's operating section is a _reconciliation_ — a bridge between two numbers. That makes it inherently spatial: there's a starting point (net income), an endpoint (cash), and every line in between is a correction with a specific source. Text explanations force you to hold the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement in your head simultaneously. A marked-up visual lets you _see_ the arrows between them.

Every adjustment line answers the same question: _did accrual accounting get ahead of (or behind) the actual cash?_ Stop memorizing signs — ask "did this help or hurt my bank balance compared to what the income statement claims?" and the sign follows automatically.

‍

Imagine embed — linguistics

I know "every student read a book" has two readings but when I write both out in English they look identical. Visualize where the two meanings actually diverge, because it's clearly not in the words.

You've hit on exactly why linguists reach for logic notation — English word order flattens something that's actually _nested_. The divergence lives in which quantifier wraps around which.

"Every" and "a" are both quantifiers, and quantifiers _nest_. The sentence gives you the pieces but doesn't tell you which one wraps the other. That's the fork:

The real divergence is in **which quantifier gets to pick first**. ∀∃ hands each student the existential separately — nothing forces them to agree. ∃∀ picks the book _once_, up front, and that single choice has to work for everyone. English defaults to the weak one and lets context drag the strong one out when it's needed.

### Practicing what you just learned

Stay hands-on while you study — the quiz appears right where you're learning, so you're trying things while the idea is fresh.

Imagine embed — graph-quiz

I keep getting distance-vs-speed graph questions wrong on tests. Give me one practice question that targets that confusion — something I'll want to answer fast and then find out where my instinct was off.

One minute on the clock — answer the way you would on a test, then we'll unpack what it was doing.

Practice · Q1 1:00

The graph shows the **total distance** a cyclist has traveled over 50 minutes. During which 10-minute interval was the cyclist traveling **fastest**?

Check answer Pick one first

What the test was doing

The question asked about **speed** (a rate) but the y-axis plots **distance** (a cumulative amount). When the axis is a total, **rate lives in the slope**, not in how high the curve sits.  
  
This swap recurs everywhere: total revenue vs. growth, total downloads vs. daily downloads, water level vs. fill rate. Different labels, same trick.

Show heights Show slopes

Click any dot on the curve to inspect that interval.

## Things to try out while studying with Claude

### 1\. See the mechanism behind an explanation

When a concept has moving parts — a cycle, a cascade, a sequence that fires in order — a static diagram shows you one frame of it. Ask Claude, and you can turn the explanation into something more alive and interactive.

-   _"Show me how mechanism works, step by step — I want to watch it move, not just read the steps"_
-   _"Walk me through one pass of this process. I want to see what happens at each stage"_
-   ‍_"A concept from class has moving parts I can't picture. Draw where each piece goes"_

### 2\. See the thing you can't picture

Some passages describe a structure, a sequence, a shape and assume you can picture it. When you can't, paste the text. Claude draws the thing the words refer to. The explanation stays the same; what you get is the picture that was missing.

-   ‍_"Here's a passage I can't picture. Draw what it's describing so I can see it."_
-   _"I keep rereading this and it's not landing. Show me what this concept actually looks like."_
-   _"The textbook explains this in words. I need the diagram it didn't include."_

### 3\. Apply a concept as you learn it

Sometimes the way to learn a thing is to practice it — try it, get it wrong, see why. Ask Claude for something interactive and you get a tool to practice on with the explanation right there as you go: a simulation where you change the inputs, a quiz that shows you where you're off, a problem that responds while you work it.

-   ‍_"I get this concept on paper. Give me something interactive so I can try it and see what changes."_
-   _"Explain this topic, then let me put it in my own words. Show me where I've got it wrong."_
-   _"Quiz me on this concept — I want to find the gaps before the exam does."_

### 4\. Work through your own material

Bring what you have — lab data, lecture notes, a difficult problem. As you chat with Claude, a visual appears built around the topic: a chart to dig into together, a map of your notes, a quiz, a correction.

-   ‍_"Here's my \[data / notes / draft\]. Help me see what's in it before I write anything up."_
-   _"These are my notes so far. Map how the ideas connect so I can see what's still missing."_
-   _"I know something's wrong in here: \[upload\]. Walk me through where I went off."_

## What you can do with what Claude draws

**Make it interactive —** If what you got is static and you want it to move, say so — "let me adjust this" or "make it interactive" is enough.

**Go deeper —** Buttons at the bottom of a visual send a follow-up. Click one and a new visual appears below. The first one stays, so you scroll between them. What you see in the first visual can shape the follow up questions for what you learn next.

**Adjust** **—** The first version is a starting point. Say what's missing, or what's too simple, or what's off and Claude redraws. Add a layer, make the practice harder, fix the formatting if it came back cramped. The visual can evolve with the conversation.

**Evaluate** **—** Look at what Claude drew with some skepticism. It's built for your question, not pulled from a verified source, so it can be wrong in ways a textbook figure usually isn't. Checking it is good for you: spotting an error means you understand well enough to notice one. Not being sure tells you where your grasp is still shaky. Both leave you better off than taking the picture at face value.

**Save it.** To keep or build on your visual, hover over what Claude drew and a few options appear in the corner.

-   `Copy as image` — snapshot for notes or slides. The move most of the time.
-   `Save as artifact` — when you'd reopen the interactive version or share it. The whiteboard becomes a document.
-   `Download` — source code (.svg or .html).

**Take it further.** Ask Claude to help you write up what clicked from the visual in a doc for your notes. Explain it to someone else to test whether it stuck. Or ask Claude to map what you now understand and what's still fuzzy; articulating one gap often surfaces the next. Either way, check the content against a real source before treating it as authoritative.

## A few practical things

-   If you expected a visual and didn't get one, any version of "show me" or "visualize this" brings one in.
-   If the visual renders oddly — overlapping elements, cut-off labels — ask Claude to fix the formatting.
-   Works on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) web and the desktop apps. Not on mobile yet.
