## **What is the Prior Auth Review sample skill?**

The Prior Authorization skill is a sample skill that digests request packet documentation and performs several initial checks to be verified by a human reviewer.  These include:

-   NPI Physician Registry
-   ICD-10 Lookup
-   CMS Coverage Database
-   CPT Codes

It then extracts clinical data to summarize the argument for medical necessity and confirms all the required documentation is present.

This is a sample skill that gives you a starting point to customize for your own use cases. Be sure to review the [README.md](https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare/releases/download/v1.0.0/prior-auth-review-skill-v1.0.0.zip) file before using the skill.

## **Who should use the Prior Auth Review sample skill?**
