## **What is the Clinical Trial Protocol Draft Generation demo skill?**

The Clinical Trial Protocol Draft Generation demo skill digests initial documentation about a new medical device or investigational drug, and follows regulatory guidelines to generate an initial phase 2 or 3 trial protocol draft.  It does this by:

1.  Searching for relevant FDA guidances to determine classification & pathway
2.  Reviews OpenFDA and ClinicalTrials.gov for predicate devices and similar trials
3.  Uses a statistically significant sample size calculator to the determine treatment arm
4.  Drafts an initial full protocol following the formal FDA/NIH template for IND & IVD protocols

This is a sample skill that gives you a starting point to customize for your own use cases. Be sure to review the [README.md](https://github.com/anthropics/life-sciences/releases/download/v1.1.1/clinical-trial-protocol-skill-v1.1.1.zip) file before using the skill.
