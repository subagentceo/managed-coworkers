The Benchling integration connects Claude to Benchling R&D platform data, enabling scientists to ask questions and receive clear summaries with links back to source experiments, notebooks, and structured records—all while maintaining existing access permissions. This article explains how to set up and use the Benchling integration with Claude to advance your R&D workflows.

The Benchling integration relies upon Claude's ability to [use remote connectors](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11724452-browsing-and-connecting-to-tools-from-the-directory).

## **What this integration provides**

When Claude sends a query to Benchling, it can search across the full breadth of a customer’s Benchling environment. This covers experimental results and study data, notebook content such as text and attachments, and structured records like registry items, inventory, and templates. The Benchling integration brings these different data types together to provide a unified answer, saving scientists from having to manually piece information across entries or projects. You can also choose to pull in public literature sources, combining internal and external knowledge in one place. All results follow the same access permissions already set in Benchling, ensuring people only see the data they are meant to.
