## **What is the Instrument Data to Allotrope skill?**

The instrument-to-allotrope skill converts raw laboratory instrument output files (CSVs, Excel, Txt, etc.) into standardized [Allotrope](https://www.allotrope.org/) Simple Model (ASM) JSON format or flattened 2D CSVs for easier integration with LIMS, ELNs, and data lakes. It auto-detects instrument types and when applicable, uses the [allotropy library](https://pypi.org/project/allotropy/) (authored by Benchling) to parse files. It also generates exportable Python parser code so data engineers can reliably replicate the conversion in production pipelines. Users may consider customizing the skill to use their specific data schemas or file output formats instead of the Allotrope standard.

## **Who should use the Instrument Data to Allotrope skill?**

This skill is designed for lab scientists, data managers, and informatics teams working with laboratory instruments who need to standardize disparate instrument outputs (cell counters, plate readers, spectrophotometers, etc.) into a consistent format for downstream analysis, regulatory submissions, or integration with enterprise data systems without writing code from scratch.
