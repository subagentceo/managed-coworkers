The Owkin connector powers Pathology Explorer, an Owkin AI agent that transforms H&E pathology slides into queryable insights for drug discovery and development and clinical research. This article explains how to set up and use the Owkin integration with Claude to accelerate pathology-driven research.

The Owkin integration relies upon Claude's ability to [use remote connectors](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11724452-browsing-and-connecting-to-tools-from-the-directory).

## **What this integration provides**

Owkin builds AI agents for biology to accelerate drug discovery, de-risk and accelerate clinical trials. The Owkin connector gives Claude access to Pathology Explorer, an Owkin agent that transforms H&E slides from the TCGA database into granular, queryable insights. Researchers can use it to automatically detect cell types from pathology images, spatially analyze tumor micro-environments, and validate hypotheses through cohort-level survival analysis, accelerating and de-risking drug discovery and development. 

The Pathology Explorer offers a range of capabilities, allowing Claude to analyze histopathological slides. Below is an extended description of the slide-level features provided by the model.

‍

**Count and density features**

For each cell type (lymphocytes, neutrophils, plasmocytes, fibroblasts, eosinophils, cancer cell), the model provides:

-   count\_{cell\_type}: The total number of cells of the specified type detected in the slide.
-   global\_density\_{cell\_type}: The density of the specified cell type per unit area of the tissue.

**Morphological features of the nucleus**

For each cell type, the model provides:

-   mean\_area\_{cell\_type}: The average area of the nuclei of the specified cell type in the slides.
-   mean\_circularity\_{cell\_type}: The average circularity of the nuclei of the specified cell type in the slides.
-   mean\_perimeter\_{cell\_type}: The average perimeter of the nuclei of the specified cell type in the slides.

**Spatial organization features**

For three types of regions (tumor, tumor core and tumor core stroma), the model provides for each cell type:

-   density\_{cell\_type}\_in\_{region}: The density of the specified cell type within the specified region.

For each region, the model also provides:

-   area\_{region}: The area of the specified region in the slide.

In addition, for a selection of biologically relevant cell-cell interactions, the model provides:

-   average\_co\_occurrence\_{cell\_type}\_{cell\_type2}\_rad\_20.0um: The average co-occurrence of the two specified cell types nuclei within a radius of 20 micrometers.

The model also computes the tils\_diffusivity, a metric for quantifying the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes diffusivity for the slide.

‍

-   TCGA\_ACC
-   TCGA\_BLCA

## **Example use cases**

-   **Refine patient stratification.** Identify patient subgroups that generalist models miss through granular profiling of 6 distinct cell types (including understudied populations like neutrophils and eosinophils). Leverage spatial organization analysis to characterize TME structures and phenotypes beyond simple counts.  
    -   Example prompt: _"I'm looking for Lung Adenocarcinoma patients that might be resistant to immunotherapy. Are there cases with low immune infiltration in the TCGA cohort?"_
-   **Visualize whole-slide images.** Build confidence in the model output by retrieving whole-slide images directly within the chat interface.  
    -   Example prompt: _"Find the slide the most enriched in eosinophils from cohort TCGA\_BRCA and plot it."_
-   **Assess prognostic value of H&E based markers.** Test clinical hypotheses by performing survival analysis on your cohorts, by splitting patients based on features such as specific cell densities or spatial scores.  
    -   Example prompt: _"Is the density of plasmocytes associated with overall survival in bladder carcinoma?"_
-   **Extract quantitative evidence for reproducibility.** Build trust in AI-generated insights by retrieving the underlying raw data for independent verification or downstream analysis.  
    -   Example prompt: _"Export the breakdown of all cell types for patient TCGA-A2-A0YI-01Z-00-DX1.1CF2EC2D-C722-467F-8832-409B823E8D8F.svs in parquet format, so I can reproduce this analysis."_
-   **Understand Owkin’s Pathology Explorer capabilities and context.** Gain transparency into the model by querying its technical specifications directly. Learn about the supported cell types, the pan-cancer training dataset and more, to ensure the model is appropriate for your research question.
