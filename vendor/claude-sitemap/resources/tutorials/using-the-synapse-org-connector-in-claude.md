The Synapse.org integration by Sage Bionetworks allows researchers to discover biomedical data across all of Synapse, see the structure of projects, and retrieve information on their data assets for authorized users. This article explains how to set up and use the Synapse.org integration with Claude to advance your research and analysis workflows.

The Synapse.org integration relies upon Claude's ability to [use remote connectors](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11724452-browsing-and-connecting-to-tools-from-the-directory).

## What this integration provides

Services include search and (meta)data retrieval services. Data access will be governed by the access controls defined for each project. Some data are publicly available, while others require approval from Synapse’s governance team prior to access.

## Who can access the Synapse.org integration

-   Individuals who have a registered Synapse account ([register for free](https://accounts.synapse.org/register1?appId=synapse.org))
-   Data access may be subject to use restriction from contributors

More details on accessing the integration can be found in [Synapse’s MCP Server Documentation](https://github.com/susheel/synapse-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#synapse-mcp-server).
