The ToolUniverse MCP gives Claude access to a library of 600+ vetted scientific tools to explore large hypothesis spaces, compare competing hypotheses, and iterate through fast-to-slow cycles of analysis. This article explains how to set up and use the ToolUniverse integration with Claude.

The ToolUniverse integration is available as a desktop extension in the Claude Desktop App ([download here](https://claude.ai/download)), and it relies upon Claude's ability to use [local connectors via a desktop extension](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-local-mcp-servers-on-claude-desktop).

## **About the ToolUniverse integration**

ToolUniverse is an ecosystem for building AI scientists and AI agents for science that work with researchers to generate hypotheses, turn them into executable research plans, run scientific tools, and continually update analyses. It targets research at scale to reimagine scientific discovery: AI scientists explore large hypothesis spaces, compare competing hypotheses, and iterate through fast-to-slow cycles of analysis instead of producing one-off summaries.

ToolUniverse standardizes tool use. It lets AI scientists discover and execute tools via local Python functions and remote services served through MCP. This design makes every step inspectable: AI scientists compose end-to-end workflows that connect datasets, models, and analysis pipelines and record inputs and outputs before they choose the next action. In human-AI collaboration, ToolUniverse supports a continuous loop of hypothesis generation, information-seeking tool calls, execution of research objectives, and refinement of internal models as new experimental data arrive and insights are generated.

## **Setting up the ToolUniverse integration**

The ToolUniverse integration is available as a desktop extension in the Claude Desktop App ([download here](https://claude.ai/download)). For Organization Owners (Team and Enterprise), setting up the integration involves making the extension available to your organization. For individual users, setting up the integration involves installing the extension from inside the Claude Desktop App.

‍

**For Organization Owners (Team and Enterprise)**

_If your organization uses the Desktop Extension Allowlist (i.e., restricts which Desktop Extensions users can access)…_

1.  Navigate to Admin settings > Connectors
2.  Click “Desktop” tab at the top
3.  Confirm that “Allowlist” it toggled **on**
4.  Click the “Browse” button
5.  In the search field, type “**ToolUniverse**”
6.  Click on ToolUniverse
7.  Click “Add to your team”
8.  Instruct your team to download the [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download) to access the integration by following the instructions below for Individual Claude Users

_If your organization does not use the Desktop Extension Allowlist (i.e., does not restrict which Desktop Extensions users can access)…_

1.  Navigate to Admin settings > Connectors
2.  Click “Desktop” tab at the top
3.  Confirm that “Allowlist” it toggled **off**
4.  If the Allowlist is toggled off, all users in your organization will already be able to access the Desktop Extension directory using the instructions below for Individual Claude Users
