Foreword Introduction: The thinking divide
Enterprises are no longer deciding whether to adopt AI, but how fast and at what
scale. Our September 2025 Anthropic Economic Index reports that in the U.S.,
40 percent of employees report using AI at work, up from 20 percent in 2023.
While these are significant gains, a looming question remains: will AI produce
lasting advantages or incremental gains that plateau within a quarter?
The answer depends entirely on scope. Organizations that treat AI as a point
solution get point-solution results. A chatbot here, a summarizer there, a pilot
that impresses as a demo but never scales (or gets users) beyond the team that
built it. This type of adoption initiative can be genuinely beneficial, but it does
not change how the organization operates.
Enterprises with successful AI transformation strategies rethink three things
simultaneously: how employees work, how processes run, and what products are
possible. This path ensures that AI is not just bolted onto existing workflows but
fully embedded into the way your employees work; it guarantees processes that
capture and share essential institutional knowledge to benefit the entire org; and
it transforms the way customers experience the product.
This is the agentic thinking divide. On one side, organizations deploy AI as a
chatbot, a tool that answers questions in isolation and delivers modest results.
On the other, they embrace agentic AI, systems that reason through complex
tasks, execute multi-step workflows, and apply domain expertise, making it
fundamental to how they operate and pull ahead. With increasingly capable
models and tooling like skills and plugins, functions beyond engineering, such
as legal, marketing, sales, and operations, can now deploy AI that acts on their
domain-specific tasks, not just answers questions about them.
In this guide, we explore what leading organizations are doing to drive
transformation with AI agents across three key pillars: employees, processes,
and products. We also walk through how to implement Claude Cowork and its
system of integrated features across your organization, without requiring every
team to build from scratch.

Key concepts for business leaders
The language of AI is evolving as fast as the technology itself. This section
defines the key terms and concepts referenced throughout this guide, providing
a shared vocabulary for evaluating and implementing AI at the enterprise level.
Terms and definitions
Agent
Agents are AI systems that go beyond simple question-and-answer interactions.
Where a traditional chatbot responds to a single prompt, an agent can
independently plan, make decisions, and use tools across multiple steps to
complete a task. Agents determine how to accomplish a goal on their own,
selecting the right tools and adjusting their approach based on what they learn
along the way.
Chatbot
A chatbot is an AI interface designed for single-turn interactions. A user asks
a question, and the chatbot provides a response. Chatbots are effective for
straightforward tasks like answering FAQs or retrieving specific information, but
they do not plan, take action, or follow through on multi-step tasks the way an
agent does.
Claude
Claude is Anthropic's AI assistant. It can read and generate text, analyze
documents, write code, and reason through complex problems. Claude serves as
the foundation for both chatbot and agentic experiences, and can be extended
with tools like MCP, skills, and plugins (see below) to perform specialized work
across an organization.
Claude Code
Claude Code is a developer-focused interface that allows engineers to work with
Claude directly in their development environment. It can read and edit code,
run commands, search across codebases, and manage complex development
tasks, functioning as an AI collaborator embedded in the developer's existing
workflow.
Claude Cowork
Claude Cowork is Anthropic's collaborative AI interface that brings the
capabilities of Claude Code to everyone. It allows anyone in an organization to
work with Claude on complex tasks through a familiar, accessible experience,
without requiring coding knowledge or developer tools. Claude Cowork allows
knowledge workers to build decks, analyze spreadsheets, compile research, and
more tasks across local files, folders, and applications.
MCP
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a universal standard that allows Claude to
connect securely to external services, such as an organization's internal tools and
data sources. MCP lets Claude pull from and interact with systems like CRMs,
databases, internal platforms, and third-party applications directly, keeping
responses grounded in real-time, relevant information.
Plugins
Plugins are pre-built packages that customize Claude for a specific role, team, or
organization. They combine the tools, workflows, and knowledge sources a team
needs into a single, ready-to-use configuration, so employees get a purpose-built
AI assistant without any setup on their end.
Skills
Skills are reusable, predefined workflows that teach Claude how to perform
specific tasks consistently. Claude includes a library of built-in skills, and anyone
can create custom skills tailored to their specific needs.

Chapter 1
Upskilling employees
The earliest AI adopters, including software engineers and financial analysts,
were the first to see the value in automating and delegating tasks to LLMs and
agents. These productivity gains are now within reach of every knowledge
worker. AI is showing up in the tools employees already use—spreadsheets, slide
decks, messaging platforms, the desktop itself—and capabilities have moved far
beyond autocomplete suggestions and simple drafts.
When they can hand over the repetitive, time-consuming, and information-
dense parts of a job to AI, employees can focus on the strategic work that
requires their judgement and skillset. A financial analyst stops spending hours
pulling data from three different systems and dives into interpreting what the
data means. A marketer stops rebuilding the same competitive analysis from
scratch every quarter and starts refining the strategy behind it. In this new
chapter, expertise does not go away: it goes further.
Tailoring AI to your organization
To work at scale, an organization’s AI deployments cannot be generic. A general-
purpose AI system that knows nothing about your organization produces
general-purpose output that your knowledge workers must edit, deepen, and
customize before it is useful. The real gains come when AI reflects how your
organization actually works: your standards, your terminology, your tools,
your institutional knowledge. That is the difference between AI that drafts a
document and AI that drafts a document your team can easily ship.
Consider what this looks like for a sales team. With the right configuration,
Claude connects directly to your CRM, your meeting recording platform, and
your prospect research tools. Before a call, an advisor runs a single command
and receives a brief that synthesizes the prospect's company data, previous
interaction history, open deals, and relevant competitive intelligence. That brief
used to take hours of manual research across four or five different applications. In
the AI-integrated organization, it takes seconds.
The same pattern applies cross-organizationally across team functions. Your
finance team's Claude agents connect to your data warehouse and produce
reconciliation reports using your chart of accounts and your reporting standards.
Your legal team's Claude-powered system reviews contracts against your
specific risk framework and flags deviations from your approved terms. Your
marketing team's Claude Project drafts campaign briefs that follow your brand
guidelines and pulls performance data from your analytics platform. In each
case, the AI is working within your existing institutional context while producing
output that satisfies each team’s specific needs.
This is why encoding organizational knowledge is powerful. Two companies
using the same model will get dramatically different results depending on
how much context they give it. The organization that teaches Claude its sales
methodology, its compliance requirements, its brand voice, and its reporting
standards will see outputs that feel like they came from an experienced
colleague.
"Our auto-evaluation capabilities, such as LLM-as-a-judge, have proven
many times the superiority of Claude models."
- Thomas Menard, Head of Agentic Platform and LAB, L'Oreal

What success looks like
The clearest signal that AI is making employees smarter, not just faster, is when
the value is immediate and the setup is minimal. A regional sales manager runs
a command before a client call and receives a brief that would have taken an
analyst an hour to assemble. A brand manager in a country office asks a question
about quarterly performance and gets a visualization with sourced data in
seconds, without submitting a ticket to the analytics team. It just works.
Equally important, employees no longer need to be engineers to build and
configure the tools that help them do their best work. Specialist knowledge
encoded into plugins and shared across the organization means the best
practices of one team become the default for every team. The knowledge stops
being tribal and starts being institutional.
This is the pattern that separates AI adoption from AI transformation. Adoption
puts a tool in front of employees, while transformation changes the baseline of
what every employee can accomplish.
L'Oreal
The challenge
L'Oreal’s famed skincare, haircare, makeup, and fragrance elixirs are sold
in over 150 countries around the globe, and their internal data pipelines
were as widespread as their beauty products. Employees who needed data
insights had to request custom dashboards for every question. That meant
submitting a request, waiting for a specialist to build the query, and hoping
the result answered the right question. The painfully slow and technical
process was a bottleneck between the teams who knew how to extract data
and those who needed it for their everyday work.
The approach
The company built a Claude-based internal AI platform, creating a multi-
agent system that transforms natural language questions into data insights
and visualizations. The platform was designed so that anyone in the
organization, regardless of technical background, could get the information
they needed to make better decisions. Claude routes queries to the right
data sources and 15 or more specialized agents, then synthesizes results
into clear answers with visualizations so employees can now query data
directly rather than building custom dashboards for each question.
The results
The platform now serves 44,000 monthly users generating 2.5
million messages per month, with 15,000 daily active users. Accuracy
on conversational analytics improved from 90 percent with previous
generative AI approaches to 99.9 percent with Claude. Teams across
marketing, product development, and sales now access and analyze
information directly, making every employee measurably more effective
regardless of technical background. The platform has become core
infrastructure for how L'Oreal's workforce operates.
Key metric: Achieved 99.9% accuracy on conversational analytics

Chapter 2
Accelerating processes
AI has the potential to streamline every process in an organization, from
generating quarterly planning documents to managing regulatory submissions,
legal reviews, and compliance checks. The more complex and information-dense
the process, the greater the potential gain. These bottlenecks exist not because
teams lack expertise, but because applying that expertise to large volumes of
information, with little room for error, takes time.
But process automation is only as impactful as the context behind it. A general-
purpose AI model produces general-purpose output. The organizations
seeing the biggest gains build their standards, compliance requirements, and
institutional knowledge directly into the system. When Claude can reason
across an organization’s full context, processing times drop from months to
minutes while output quality stays high, because the AI is working within the
organization’s own governed standards and requirements.
The right approach produces compounding returns. As manual processing time
and stakeholder coordination shrink, employees redirect that capacity toward
strategic and creative work. And as models continue to improve, the processes
built on top of them become more efficient without requiring teams to rebuild
from scratch.
How accuracy compounds over time
Quality is the most common concern that many enterprises have around
adopting AI augmented processes. Speed means nothing if achieving high-
quality AI output requires the same number of review-and-improve cycles as the
manual processes it’s meant to replace.
The organizations achieving the most dramatic process gains with AI avoid this
issue entirely by building systems where human expertise feeds back into the
AI's knowledge base. Functionally, these systems propagate curated knowledge:
the agents get smarter about domain knowledge over time as subject matter
experts review information and make improvements. Each new process starts
from the same baseline, and the same review effort is required every time. But
in a compounding AI system, every expert review makes every future process
better. The customer story below, for example, shows how Lyft built subject
matter expertise into their customer support AI assistant.
Self-educating, compounding AI systems help the organizations that start
earliest build the largest advantage. Every month of accumulated expert
approvals, feedback, and refinements makes the next month's output faster and
more accurate.
What success looks like
Your organization knows faster processes are working when the people doing
the work describe it differently. When, for example, a staff writer who used to
spend weeks assembling a clinical study report now explains they now spend
most of their work hours on expert review and refinement rather than drafting
from scratch. Or when a compliance officer who used to take days to produce
a regulatory filing now generates a first draft in minutes and focuses on the
judgment calls that require human expertise.
The exact organizational indicators vary role by role, but they all share a
predictable pattern. Processes that once required specialized staff become
accessible to broader teams, because the AI handles the information-dense
assembly work that previously demanded years of domain experience. And the
returns compound as more processes come into Claude's scope, because every
approved template, every vetted definition, every encoded standard makes the
next process faster and more accurate than the last.
9

-- 9 of 23 --

The deeper shift is about capacity. When a team that previously spent 80 percent
of its time producing documentation can now spend 80 percent of its time on the
judgment calls that documentation supports, the nature of the work changes.
Senior experts stop being bottlenecked by volume and start applying their
expertise where it matters most.
Junior team members gain access to institutional knowledge that previously took
years to acquire. The entire team operates at a higher level, because the AI has
absorbed the routine complexity that used to consume the majority of their hours.
Lyft
The challenge
Lyft, a global mobility platform operating across six continents and
thousands of cities, was facing an inflection point in customer support. The
number of customers contacting support was at an all-time high: riders and
drivers waited 30 to 40 minutes to reach an agent, and agents were juggling
three or four customers at once. The experience felt robotic, with rigid
workflows and copy-pasted responses that didn't address customers' actual
situations. Agent burnout was rising, and the team lacked the bandwidth to
deliver the personal support experience the company wanted.
The approach
After testing multiple AI models on both quantitative performance and
brand-voice alignment, Lyft selected Claude to power its customer support
AI assistant. The team started with driver support, where onboarding
involves region-specific requirements layered on platform-wide policies.
From there, Lyft expanded to rider support for charge disputes, ride issues,
and other cases previously requiring human investigation. Claude greets
customers by name, investigates their specific situation, and resolves
issues in seconds. When cases require human judgment, the system routes
customers to agents with AI-generated conversation summaries.
The results
Customer support resolution time dropped by over 87%. Decision-making
accuracy improved by over 30%. The company reinvested the millions of
dollars in savings back into its support agents and new customer programs.
Organizing their people and processes around a Claude-powered AI
system now lets Lyft:
• Resolve customer issues in seconds rather than the previous 30-to-40-
minute wait times
• Free up agents to handle one customer at a time instead of juggling
multiple chats
• Fund new programs like Lyft Silver, dedicated one-on-one support
for older riders
• Shift support agents from high-burnout volume work to complex issues
requiring human care and empathy
Key metric: 87% reduction in customer support resolution time, with over
30% improvement in decision-making accuracy.

Chapter 3
Transforming product development
The enterprises building transformative internal and external products share a
pattern: they combine a frontier AI model with proprietary data, existing trust
relationships, and deep domain expertise. AI is the enabler, but the defensibility
comes from everything around it.
Deploying Claude as an intelligence layer enables new product capabilities
that go beyond marginal feature improvements. When your organization
combines a frontier AI model with your proprietary data, your existing trust
relationships, and your domain expertise, the result is something genuinely
difficult for competitors to replicate. Your data, your customer relationships, and
your domain knowledge are what make the product defensible. The AI makes it
possible to deliver that value in ways that were not feasible before.
The opportunity is not limited to cost reduction. New product capabilities generate
net-new revenue and create competitive advantages that compound over time.
The organizations that move first establish the integrations, the data flywheels, and
the customer habits that make it difficult for later entrants to catch up.
Why the trust boundary determines what ships
There is a critical constraint that determines whether a product idea reaches
customers or stays in a proof-of-concept indefinitely: integration within your
existing trust and compliance infrastructure.
In regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, data security and
regulatory compliance are not optional features. They are prerequisites. Any
AI-powered product that operates outside your trust boundary is a product that
cannot ship.
In practice, the trust boundary determines which AI integrations are possible
and which are non-starters. Financial services firms operate under regulations
that specify exactly where client data can be processed, who can access it, and
what audit trails must exist.
An AI product that requires client data to leave the firm's security perimeter,
even temporarily, triggers compliance reviews that can take months and often
end in rejection. The product might be technically superior, but if it cannot
operate within the existing trust architecture, it does not get deployed.
The lesson generalizes beyond financial services. In any industry where
customers trust you with sensitive data, the trust boundary is the first design
constraint for any AI-powered product. Organizations that solve the trust
architecture first can move quickly on product development. Organizations that
treat it as an afterthought will find that their most promising AI products stall in
compliance review indefinitely.
What success looks like
Success metrics for AI-driven product transformation differ from how we
evaluate the people and process pillars. With smarter employees, you measure
time saved and adoption rates. With faster processes, you measure cycle time
compression and quality scores. With transformative products, the question is
whether your customers can do something they could not do before.
A clear example: before Rakuten adopted Claude Managed Agents, our pre-
built, configurable agent harness available via the Claude Platform, agentic
infrastructure was their constraint. Engineering talent that should have been
building differentiated agentic experiences was consumed maintaining the
12

-- 12 of 23 --

execution layer underneath. Specialist agents took weeks of custom work to
ship, and innovation moved at the speed of the platform team. By offloading
that infrastructure entirely, Rakuten now deploys specialist agents within a
week, ships major product releases every two weeks instead of once per quarter,
and has produced something previously out of reach: a product manager who
independently builds FinOps pipelines across multiple public clouds, sets up
ambient monitoring agents, and oversees products at a pace the company had
never seen.
As Rakuten describes it, the shift is structural: by lowering the cost of coordination
and innovation, agents aren't future colleagues or competitors; they're the
infrastructure through which the company accelerates everything it builds.
The architectural decision matters just as much as the agent's capability. A
product that delivers a genuine capability shift but stalls on infrastructure no one
has time to maintain reaches customers too late to matter. Rakuten's decision to
offload the execution layer entirely was what let the team focus its investment on
the agentic experience itself.
This is where the payoff shifts. Smarter employees and faster processes reduce
costs. Transformative products generate revenue. They open new markets,
deepen customer relationships, and create switching costs that make the
platform more valuable over time. The organizations that invest here earliest will
see the largest returns, because the data, integrations, and customer habits they
establish today become the foundation for every product they build next.
Rakuten
Rakuten operates over 70 businesses spanning e-commerce, travel, fintech,
and communications. As part of its company-wide "AI-nization" strategy,
the team saw early that agents would need persistent compute, memory,
and storage to move beyond chat-based AI. Their engineers built that
infrastructure from scratch—the right call at the time, but one that consumed
significant talent that could have gone toward differentiated work.
The deeper goal wasn't running infrastructure. It was democratizing
innovation across every business function, so that any employee could
delegate outcomes to AI agents.
The approach
Rakuten adopted Claude Managed Agents to offload the execution layer
entirely, freeing their engineering talent to focus on the agentic experience
itself. The team now deploys specialist agents within a week, covering
engineering, product, sales, marketing, and finance, generating apps,
proposal decks, and spreadsheets in sandboxed environments.
Agents integrate directly with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Rakuten's own
Kanban-style task system, where employees create and assign tasks to
agents from any device. Native mobile and voice support means high-context
instructions can be captured on the go. Long-running agents work for hours,
allowing teams to delegate goals rather than individual tasks, sharing the
desired end state and letting the agent decide what work needs to happen.
Agent memory compounds results over time: agents remember what went
wrong in past sessions and avoid repeating those mistakes. Individual
learning becomes organizational learning instantly.
The results
Major product releases now ship every two weeks, down from once a quarter.
Initial critical errors dropped 97% in pilot, with agent cost and latency down
more than 30%, with no loss in output quality. Power users Rakuten calls
"Galileo" now contribute across domains far beyond their primary roles: a
product manager independently builds FinOps pipelines across multiple
public clouds, sets up ambient monitoring agents, and oversees products at a
pace the company had never seen before.
The shift Rakuten describes is structural: by lowering the cost of coordination
and innovation, agents aren't future colleagues or competitors; they're the
infrastructure through which Rakuten accelerates its contribution to society.

Bringing Claude to the
rest of your organization 14

Chapter 4
Bringing Claude to the rest of your organization
What Claude Cowork is (and how it works)
The examples in the previous chapters share a common thread: each
organization built a custom platform to give Claude the context it needed to
do meaningful work. L'Oreal built an orchestration layer with 15 specialized
agents, achieving a 99.9% accuracy on conversational analytics. Novo Nordisk
built NovoScribe, reducing clinical study documentation from 10+ weeks to 10
minutes, while maintaining regulatory quality. RBC delivered an agentic solution
serving 2,200 advisors managing $689 billion in assets. Providing advisors more
time with each customer. Each investment produced significant returns, but each
also required engineering resources, time, and technical expertise to build.
Claude Cowork changes that equation. Claude Cowork is Claude's platform
for knowledge workers, giving non-technical professionals the same agent
capabilities that enterprises have built on the API, without a custom build.
Employees set goals, delegate work, and receive finished deliverables. The
output goes beyond drafts and suggestions to actual completed work: Word
documents, Excel models, slide decks, analysis, and reports.
The mechanism that makes this practical for enterprises is plugins. Plugins
are packages of skills, context, and connectors that give Claude role-specific
expertise. A sales team's Claude knows your CRM, your pipeline, and your sales
process. A legal team's Claude knows your contract templates, your review
workflow, and your risk framework. A finance team's Claude knows your chart of
accounts, your reconciliation procedures, and your reporting standards.
Plugins are built once and shared across the organization. When a team encodes
its best practices into a plugin, those practices scale automatically to every
person who installs it. The institutional knowledge that previously lived in the
heads of your most experienced people becomes available to every new hire,
every adjacent team, every office across the organization. Anthropic has open-
sourced 11 plugins covering productivity, sales, finance, data, legal, marketing,
customer support, product management, enterprise search, biology research,
and plugin management itself.
Plugins turn institutional knowledge into organizational infrastructure.
Build once, share across every team, and best practices scale automatically.
Built for enterprise scale
Deploying AI across an entire organization raises questions that go well beyond
product features. The executives responsible for broad rollout need answers
on governance, security, auditability, integration, and workflow continuity.
Claude Cowork was designed with these requirements as foundations, not
afterthoughts.
Governance and control. Admins configure organization-specific plugin
marketplaces, controlling which plugins are available or pre-installed and
managing access across teams. This means no unsanctioned adoption, no
shadow AI sprawl, and no ambiguity about what capabilities are approved for
which roles. Your organization decides exactly what Claude can do, for whom,
and under what conditions.
The plugin marketplace model addresses a problem that every large
organization encounters with AI tools: uncontrolled proliferation. When
15

-- 15 of 23 --

individual teams find and install their own AI solutions, the result is dozens of
disconnected tools with inconsistent security postures, no central visibility, and
no way to enforce organizational standards.
Claude Cowork's marketplace model puts admins in control of the entire catalog.
Your IT team decides which plugins are available, which are pre-installed for
specific roles, and which require manager approval. When a new plugin is
published internally, it goes through your approval workflow before it reaches
any employee's machine. This transforms AI governance from a reactive exercise
into a proactive one: curating and distributing approved capabilities rather than
discovering and shutting down unauthorized tools.
Claude Cowork’s admin console also supports role-based access and spend
controls, which help organizations manage usage and spend. Usage analytics
also provide visibility into how teams are using the tool, including per-user daily
activity.
Secure by design. Claude Cowork runs tasks locally, reducing the risk of
exposure significantly and making deployment viable without a lengthy security
review. For organizations in regulated industries, this architecture addresses the
most common objection to enterprise AI adoption before it is raised.
Local execution means exactly what it sounds like: Claude processes your files,
your data, and your documents on the employee's machine. Nothing is uploaded
to a cloud service for processing.
Auditability. Visibility into what Claude is doing, when, and on whose behalf
is available today via OpenTelemetry-compatible observability tools. Your
compliance team can see exactly how AI is being used across the organization,
which matters both for internal governance and for regulatory reporting. For
industries where regulators may ask how AI was involved in a specific decision
or document, this audit trail provides the evidence chain that turns a difficult
compliance question into a straightforward answer.
Integration with existing tools. Claude works within the systems your teams
already use, including CRM platforms, document management systems, and
compliance tools, rather than requiring people to adopt a new workflow. The goal
is to make AI feel like a natural extension of the tools your organization already
runs on, not a separate system that employees have to context-switch into.
Continuity across workspaces. Work moves fluidly between Claude Cowork
and tools like Excel and PowerPoint without losing context. AI output lands
where employees already operate. An analyst can start a financial model in
Claude Cowork and continue refining it in Excel. A marketer can generate a
campaign brief and move directly into slide creation. The work stays connected
because the context travels with it.
To learn more about Claude Cowork’s enterprise controls, check out our Claude
Cowork Enterprise Admin Guide.
Practical deployment framework
The organizations that get the most from Claude Cowork share a deployment
pattern that balances ambition with discipline. Four principles guide the most
effective rollouts:
• Start with specificity, not scale. Give Claude your standards, your tools,
your institutional context from the beginning. Employees who receive
generic output from a first interaction rarely give the tool a second chance.
The organizations in this guide succeeded because they gave Claude enough
context to produce output that felt like it came from someone who understood
the business.
• Choose pilots with a measurable finish line. Each of the three pillars has
different success metrics. Smarter employees might be measured by adoption
rates and time savings. Faster processes might be measured by cycle time
compression and quality scores. Transformative products might be measured
by revenue impact and speed to market. Define your success criteria upfront,
before the pilot starts, so the results are unambiguous.
• Build plugins for reuse from the beginning. The temptation is to build a
quick solution for one team and worry about reuse later. Resist that temptation.
Plugins built for one team should benefit the entire organization. When you
encode tribal knowledge once, every team that installs the plugin gets the
16

-- 16 of 23 --

benefit immediately. The marginal cost of sharing a plugin is zero, while the
marginal value is enormous.
• Never underestimate the governance layer. Admin controls, auditability,
and organization-specific marketplaces are prerequisites for broad rollout,
not features you add after adoption takes off. The organizations that skip
governance early spend more time cleaning up unsanctioned usage than they
saved by moving fast.
Phase 1: Setting evaluation and success criteria
For the first several weeks, focus exclusively on your evaluation and success
criteria. Identify two to three teams with clear pain points and measurable
workflows. Install the relevant plugins from the open-source repository or build
custom plugins that encode your team's specific standards and processes. Define
what success looks like before anyone starts using the tool.
For a sales team, for example, that might be call prep time reduced by 50 percent.
For a legal team, it might be a contract review turnaround cut from five days to
one. For a documentation team, it might be first-draft quality reaching 80 percent
of the final approved version. The specificity of the success criteria matters: vague
goals like "improve productivity" produce vague results that are easy to dismiss.
Phase 2: Launching a champion pilot
The second and third months of the initiative are the champion pilot. Two to
three teams use Claude Cowork with their configured plugins in production
workflows, not sandboxed experiments. Measure adoption weekly. Collect
qualitative feedback alongside quantitative metrics, because the moments when
employees discover unexpected value are often more informative than time-
saved calculations.
The goal of this pilot phase is not perfection but proof of value and a clear
understanding of what needs to change before broader rollout. Getting
started with Claude Cowork in the help center provides practical guidance for
configuring access and managing this initial deployment.
17

-- 17 of 23 --

Phase 3: Scaling impact
Successful proof of concept in hand, months four through six shift to scaling and
governance. It’s time to deploy the admin marketplace controls, establish plugin
review and approval workflows, and begin the rollout to additional teams using
the plugins and configurations refined during the pilot.
Each team that comes online benefits from the institutional knowledge already
encoded, which means the second wave of adoption moves faster than the first.
The third wave moves faster still. This is the compounding dynamic in action:
every investment in context, configuration, and governance makes the next
deployment cheaper and more effective.

Compounding your company’s
AI advantage
The most common mistake organizations make with AI transformation is
waiting until the strategy is comprehensive before taking the first step. The most
successful organizations start narrow, learn fast, and expand with conviction.
They pick a process, a team, a use case where the pain is obvious and the success
criteria are clear. They give Claude the context it needs to do real work, and they
measure the results honestly.
Teams moving to centralize AI within their operations now (vs treating agentic
AI as an add-on layer) have a compounding head start: trained teams, proven
workflows, institutional knowledge encoded in plugins, and a governance
infrastructure that can support rapid expansion.
Your organization doesn’t need a perfect plan. It only needs a specific starting
point, quantifiable success criteria, and the willingness to learn from what
happens next.
