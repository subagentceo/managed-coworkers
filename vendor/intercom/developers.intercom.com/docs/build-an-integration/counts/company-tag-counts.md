The counts for your App can be obtained using `GET` against the `https://api.intercom.io/counts` URL with the `type` and `count` parameters as follows

| Count | Type Value | Count Value |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| Company Segment Count | company | segment |
| Company Tag Count | company | tag |
| Company User Count | company | user |


Pagination with company counts
Company tag counts are returned via pagination, which means it defaults to 50 results per page unless you specify otherwise. e.g. '[https://api.intercom.io/counts?type=company&count=tag&per_page=10](https://api.intercom.io/counts?type=company&count=tag&per_page=10)"

To get the next page of results you need to make a GET request with the "next" RUL supplied in the initial response.
