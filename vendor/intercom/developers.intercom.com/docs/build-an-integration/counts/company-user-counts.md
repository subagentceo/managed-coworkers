# App Total Count Model

You can use the API to get counts of users and companies filtered by certain criteria.

Counts are a legacy way to periodically obtain data for the purposes of tracking rates of change in contact and company data.

### Workspace Total Count Object

The total count object contains the summary of the following fields in a workspace, -

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| type | string | *value is 'count.hash'* |
| company | object | Contains the number of companies in your App |
| segment | object | Contains the number of segments in your App |
| tag | object | Contains the number of tags in your App |
| user | object | Contains the number of users in your App |
| lead | object | Contains the number of leads in your App |


The count of tags and segments includes archived tags and segments.
