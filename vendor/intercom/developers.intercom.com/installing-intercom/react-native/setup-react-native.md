# Setup

The Intercom React Native wrapper allows you to use [Intercom for iOS](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios) and/or [Intercom for Android](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-android) in your React Native apps.
If you’re new to Intercom, you’ll need to [create an account and start your free trial](https://www.intercom.com).

> 📘 Supported versions
The Intercom React Native wrapper supports version **0.59** of React Native and above.
Intercom for iOS supports **iOS 13** and above.
Intercom for Android supports **API 21** and above.


## Step 1 - Adding the wrapper

To install Intercom you'll need to add the wrapper to your React Native project using the following snippet:


```text
yarn add @intercom/intercom-react-native
```


```text
npm install @intercom/intercom-react-native
```

There are separate steps for setting up Android and iOS. If your React Native app does not support Android skip to [Step 3](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/react-native-installation#section-step-3-ios-setup).

## Step 2 - Android Setup

You'll need to take steps to link the wrapper in your project. These vary based on your apps React Native version.

### Using React Native v0.60 and above

If you're using React Native v0.60 or above, the library will be linked automatically

### Automatic linking with React Native v0.59

To automatically link the Intercom React Native wrapper in v0.59 of React Native run the following command:


```text
react-native link @intercom/intercom-react-native
```

### Manual linking with React Native v0.59

If you prefer to manually link libraries, add the following snippet to `android/settings.gradle`:


```groovy
include ':intercom-react-native'
project(':intercom-react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@intercom/intercom-react-native/android')
```

Inside the dependancies block of `android/app/build.gradle` add the following line:


```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation project(':intercom-react-native')
}
```

> 🚧 Apps using a React Native version below 0.65
React Native versions below 0.65 use OkHttp 3. The Intercom SDK currently uses OkHttp 4.
There is a problem with compatibility between those two versions which may result in crashes.
You can fix this by adding an explicit dependency on `okhttp-urlconnection` to dependencies in `app/build.gradle`:

```
dependencies {
	implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-urlconnection:4.9.1")
	[...]
}
```


## Initialize Intercom

> 🚧 Minimum Android SDK and build tools versions
The `minSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` needs to be to `21` or greater
In the dependencies block of the `build.gradle` make sure that
`com.android.tools.build:gradle` is at version `4.0.1`


You'll need to update the `MainApplication.java` class.  First add the import `com.intercom.reactnative.IntercomModule` at the top of the class.

Then in the `onCreate` method, add the snippet below using the `apiKey` and `appId` found in your [workspace settings](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/settings/android).


```java
import com.intercom.reactnative.IntercomModule; //  <-- Add this line

// ...

@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
  SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false);

  // ...

  IntercomModule.initialize(this, "apiKey", "appId"); // <-- Add this line

  // ...
}
```

#### Android Permissions

Add below permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`

**Image Attachments**: No additional permissions are required for image attachments on modern Android versions (Android 10+). The SDK uses the system photo picker and scoped storage APIs that don't require storage permissions.

You can also include [VIBRATE](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#VIBRATE) to enable vibration in push notifications:


```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

## Step 3 - iOS Setup

If you don't support iOS in your React Native app, you can skip to the [configuration step](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/react-native-configuration).

### Using React Native v0.60 and above

If you're using React Native v0.60 or above, the library will be linked automatically after running the `pod install` command.

### Manual linking with React Native v0.59

Firstly open your apps `.xcworkspace`. If you don't have a `.workspace` file open the `.xcodeproj`.
[Download intercom for iOS and extract the zip](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios/archive/master.zip)
Drag Intercom.xcframework into your project. Make sure **"Copy items if needed"** is selected and click Finish.

For additional information on iOS manual linking please refer to the [React Native developer docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking-libraries-ios).

## Initialize Intercom

For Objective-C, open `iOS/AppDelegate.m` and import `<IntercomModule.h>`.

For Swift, open `iOS/AppDelegate.swift` and import `intercom_react_native`.


```objectivec
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <React/RCTBridge.h>
#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>
// ...
#import <IntercomModule.h> // <-- Add This
```


```swift
import intercom_react_native
```

Next, in the method `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` you'll need to initialize Intercom. Add the snippet below using the `apiKey` and `appId` found in your [workspace settings](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/settings/ios).


```objectivec
// ...
  self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;

  [IntercomModule initialize:@"apiKey" withAppId:@"appId"]; // <-- Add this (Remember to replace strings with your api keys)

  return YES;
  }
```


```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  ....
     Intercom.setApiKey("<Your iOS API Key>", forAppId: "<Your App ID>")
  ....
}
```

#### iOS Permissions

Add these permissions to your `Info.plist`:


```xml
<!-- Optional: Camera access for taking photos in conversations -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Access your camera to take photos within a conversation</string>

<!-- Optional: Microphone access for voice message transcription (v9.3.0+) -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Access your microphone to transcribe voice messages in conversations</string>
```

**Note:** These permissions are only requested when the user attempts to use the respective feature. You can customize the description strings to match your app's use case.

**Photo Library (Optional):** For apps that support iOS 13 or lower, you may also want to add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`. On iOS 14+, Intercom uses the PHPickerViewController API which does not require photo library permission.

## What next?

1. Once you've got Intercom installed it's time to use it on your [React Native app](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/using-intercom-react-native).
2. [Enable push notifications](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/react-native-push-notifications) so you can send push messages.
3. [Enable Identity Verification](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/react-native-identity-verification) for your React Native app.
