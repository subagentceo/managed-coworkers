### Create a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a *Checkout Session* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription), setting the [ui_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-ui_mode) to `embedded_page`.

The Checkout Session response includes a client secret, which the client uses to mount Checkout. Return the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) in your response.

### Create a Checkout Session

Add a [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) to your application that creates a *Checkout Session* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription), setting the [ui_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-ui_mode) to `embedded_page`.

The Checkout Session response includes a client secret, which the client uses to mount Checkout. Return the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) from the function.

### Supply a return URL

To define how Stripe redirects your customer after payment, specify the URL of the return page in the [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-return_url) parameter while creating the Checkout Session. After the payment attempt, Stripe directs your customer to return page hosted on your website.

Include the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable in the URL. Before redirecting your customer, Checkout replaces the variable with the Checkout Session ID. You’re responsible for creating and hosting the return page on your website.

### Define a product to sell

Define the products you’re selling when you create the Checkout Session by using [predefined price IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=embedded-page#create-product-prices-upfront).

Always keep sensitive information about your product inventory, such as price and availability, on your server to prevent customer manipulation from the client.

### Choose the mode

To handle different transaction types, adjust the `mode` parameter. For one-time payments, use `payment`. To initiate recurring payments with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=embedded-page), switch the `mode` to `subscription`. And for [setting up future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md?platform=web&ui=embedded-page), set the `mode` to `setup`.

### Add Stripe to your React app

To stay *PCI compliant* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details go directly to Stripe and never reach your server, install [React Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md).

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Load Stripe.js

To configure the Stripe library, call `loadStripe()` with your Stripe publishable API key.

### Load Stripe.js

Use *Stripe.js* (Use Stripe.js’ APIs to tokenize customer information, collect sensitive card data, and accept payments with browser payment APIs) to remain *PCI compliant* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details are sent directly to Stripe without hitting your server. Always load Stripe.js from *js.stripe.com* to remain compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host it yourself.

### Define the payment form

To securely collect the customer’s information, create an empty placeholder `div`. Stripe inserts an iframe into the `div`.

### Initialize Stripe.js

Initialize Stripe.js with your [publishable API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys).

### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret

Create an asynchronous `fetchClientSecret` function that makes a request to your server to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret.

### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret

Import the Server Action to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret, passing it to the [`fetchClientSecret`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/embedded_checkout/create#embedded_checkout_create-options-fetchClientSecret) parameter.

### Initialize Checkout

Initialize Checkout with your `fetchClientSecret` function and mount it to the placeholder `<div>` in your payment form. Checkout is rendered in an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection.

Avoid placing Checkout within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.

### Initialize Checkout

To allow the child components to access the Stripe service through the embedded Checkout consumer, pass the resulting promise from `loadStripe` and the client secret as an `option`  to the embedded Checkout provider.

### Create an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session status.

### Add a return page

To display order information to your customer, create a return page for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.

### Add a return component

To display order information to your customer, add a new route and return component for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.

### Add a return page

To display order information to your customer, add a file under `pages/` for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return_url`. Stripe redirects your customer to this page after they check out.

### Retrieve a Checkout session

As soon as your return page loads, immediately make a request to the endpoint on your server. Use the Checkout Session ID in the URL to retrieve the status of the Checkout Session.

### Handle session

Handle the result of the session by using its status:

- `complete`: The payment succeeded. Use the information from the Checkout Session to render a success page.
- `open`: The payment failed or was canceled. Remount Checkout so that your customer can try again.

### Set your environment variables

Add your publishable and secret keys to a `.env` file. Next.js automatically loads them into your application as [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

Each webhook endpoint has a unique signing secret. Webhooks are managed in [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md) in the Dashboard. You can find the secret in the destination detail view for your webhook endpoint in Workbench’s [Webhooks tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks). If you’re testing locally with the Stripe CLI, you can also get the secret from the CLI output using the command `stripe listen`.

To include a webhook endpoint signing secret to listen to [events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md), go to Workbench’s [Event destinations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks) tab or use the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).

### Run the application

Start your server and go to <http://localhost:4242/checkout.html>

### Run the application

Start your server and go to <http://localhost:3000/checkout>

### Run the application

Start your app with `npm run dev` and go to <http://localhost:3000>

### Try it out

Click the pay button to complete the payment, which redirects you to the specified return page.

If you see the return page, and the payment in the list of [successful payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=successful) in the Dashboard, your integration is successfully working. Use any of the following test cards to simulate a payment:

| Scenario                            | Card Number      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Payment succeeds                    | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment requires 3DS authentication | 4000002500003155 |
| Payment is declined                 | 4000000000009995 |

## Congratulations!

You have a basic Checkout integration working. Now learn how to customize the appearance of your checkout page and automate tax collection.

### Customize the checkout page

[Customize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization.md) the appearance of the embedded form by:

- Adding your color theme and font in your [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding/checkout).
- Using the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md)to activate additional features, like collecting addresses and prefilling customer data.

### Prefill customer data

Use [customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_email) to prefill the customer’s email address in the email input field. You can also pass a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) ID to the `customer` field to prefill the email address field with the email stored on the Customer.

### Pick a submit button

Change the text of the submit button to `pay`, `donate`, or `book` by setting the [submit_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-submit_type). The default text is `pay`.

### Collect billing and shipping details

Use [billing_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-billing_address_collection) and [shipping_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection) to collect your customer’s address. [shipping_address_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection) requires a list of `allowed_countries`, which Checkout displays in a dropdown menu on the page.

### Automate tax collection

Calculate and collect the right amount of tax on your Stripe transactions. Learn more about [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax.md) and [how to add it to Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md).

### Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard

[Activate Stripe Tax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax) to monitor your tax obligations, automatically collect tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.

### Add the automatic tax parameter

Set the `automatic_tax` parameter to `enabled: true`.

### New and returning customers

By default, Checkout only creates [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) when one is required (for example, for subscriptions). Otherwise, Checkout uses [guest customers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers.md) to group payments in the Dashboard. You can optionally configure Checkout to always create a new customer or to specify a returning customer.

### Always create customers

To always create customers whenever one isn’t provided, set [customer_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_creation) to `'always'`.

### Specify returning customers

To associate a Checkout Session with a customer that already exists, provide the [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) when creating a session. If you model customers using Accounts v2, you can also pass an Account ID to the [customer_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_account) field to prefill the associated email address. Learn more about the [difference between using v1 Customers and v2 Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/accounts-v2/use-accounts-as-customers.md).
