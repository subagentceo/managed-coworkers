  #### Domain Knowledge API

  Look up the recommended driver and detected antibot systems for any domain or agent before running at scale. Returns the driver tier, a list of detected antibots (e.g. `cloudflare`, `perimeterx`, `akamai`), and whether JavaScript rendering is required.

  ```bash theme={"system"}
  GET /v1/domain-knowledge/driver?url=www.lowes.com
  GET /v1/domain-knowledge/driver?agent=target_serp
  ```

  #### Media Download API

  Download images, video, audio, and documents directly via the Nimble SDK. Two modes available: **Realtime** for instant binary downloads, and **Async** for large files delivered to your storage bucket.

  ```json theme={"system"}
  {
    "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "country": "US"
  }
  ```

  ### <Badge color="green" shape="pill" icon="feather-pointed" iconType="sharp-solid">New Features</Badge>

  #### Jobs

  Run any Web Search Agent as a managed, recurring workload — no orchestration code required. Point a job at an agent, upload your input list (CSV, Parquet, or JSON), set a schedule, and Nimble fans out one agent invocation per row on every tick.

  * **Any scale** — thousands to millions of inputs per run, with concurrency and retries handled automatically
  * **Flexible scheduling** — manual trigger, daily, weekly, monthly, or a custom cron expression
  * **Structured output** — results assembled into a single JSON, CSV, or Parquet file per run
  * **Run monitoring** — per-run success rate, completeness score, and error samples in the Nimble Platform UI

  Available now at [online.nimbleway.com/jobs](https://online.nimbleway.com/jobs).

  ### Release Notes for March, 2026

  ### <Badge color="green" shape="pill" icon="feather-pointed" iconType="sharp-solid">New Features</Badge>

  #### Agents API: Batch Endpoint

  Submit up to **1,000 agent requests in a single request** with `POST /v1/agents/batch`. Each input runs as an independent async task. Use `shared_inputs` to set the agent and common delivery settings, and override per item in `inputs` as needed.

  ```json theme={"system"}
  {
    "inputs": [
      { "params": { "keyword": "iphone 15" } },
      { "params": { "keyword": "iphone 16" } }
    ],
    "shared_inputs": { "agent": "amazon_serp" }
  }

  ### <Badge color="green" shape="pill" icon="feather-pointed" iconType="sharp-solid">New Features</Badge> <Badge color="orange" shape="pill" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="sharp-solid">Breaking Change</Badge>

  #### Agents API: Formats Parameter

  New `formats` parameter for `POST /v1/agents/run` and `POST /v1/agents/async`. Pass `"html"`, `"markdown"`, or `"headers"` to include additional data alongside `data.parsing`.

  ```json theme={"system"}
  "formats": ["html", "markdown"]
  ```

  **Breaking change:** `data.html` is no longer returned by default. To continue receiving HTML in the response, add `"html"` to the `formats` array.

  **Before:**

  ```json theme={"system"}
  { "agent": "amazon_pdp", "params": { "asin": "B08N5WRWNW" } }
  // → data.html was included automatically
  ```

  **After:**

  ```json theme={"system"}
  {
    "agent": "amazon_pdp",
    "params": { "asin": "B08N5WRWNW" },
    "formats": ["html"]
  }
  // → data.html included only when explicitly requested
  ```

  #### Extract API: New Headers Format

  New `headers` format option. Pass `"headers"` in the `formats` array to include the HTTP response headers returned by the server. Headers are returned as a key-value object under `data.headers`.

  ```json theme={"system"}
  "formats": ["html", "headers"]
  ```

  **Breaking change:** Headers are no longer returned by default. Previously, `data.headers` was included in every response automatically. To continue receiving headers, add `"headers"` to your `formats` array.

  **Before:**

  ```json theme={"system"}
  { "url": "https://example.com" }
  // → data.headers was included automatically
  ```

  **After:**

  ```json theme={"system"}
  { "url": "https://example.com", "formats": ["html", "headers"] }
  // → data.headers included only when explicitly requested
  ```

  #### Batch Extract API

  Submit up to **1,000 URLs in a single request** with `POST /v1/extract/batch`. Each URL runs as an independent async task. Use `shared_inputs` to set common settings (render, country, cloud delivery) across the batch, and override per item in `inputs` as needed.

  [View Documentation](/nimble-sdk/web-tools/extract/features/async)
