Context set is a collection of database-specific information that enables tools such as QueryData to generate queries with high accuracy. Context set includes templates, facets, and value searches that help QueryData understand your database schema and the business logic of your applications.

The following databases are supported:

-   AlloyDB for PostgreSQL
-   Cloud SQL for MySQL
-   Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
-   Spanner

## What are context sets

To build effective agentic applications, tools such as QueryData must understand your data organization and business logic. You provide this information in the form of context set.

You define context in files that contain JSON objects for each context type. You author these context files with the help of the [Gemini CLI](/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli). You then upload the context file to a context set that you create in the Google Cloud console. This process enables tools such as QueryData to learn the specific schema of the database and business logic of the application.

The context file looks similar to the following:

```
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "nl_query": "Count Prague loan accounts",
      "sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" ='Prague'",
      "intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in the Prague region?",
      "manifest": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in a given city?",
      "parameterized": {
        "parameterized_intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in $1",
        "parameterized_sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" = $1"
      }
    }
  ],
  "facets": [
    {
      "sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN 6000 AND 10000",
      "intent": "Average salary between 6000 and 10000",
      "manifest": "Average salary between a given number and a given number",
      "parameterized": {
         "parameterized_intent": "Average salary between $1 and $2",
         "parameterized_sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN $1 AND $2"
      }
    }
  ],
  "value_searches": [
    {
      "query": "SELECT $value as value, 'accounts.account_type' as columns, 'Account Type' as concept_type, 0 as distance, '{}'::text as context FROM \"accounts\" T WHERE T.\"account_type\" = $value",
      "concept_type": "Account Type",
      "description": "Exact match for account types"
    }
   ]
}
```

## Context set file format

Context set file consists of a curated set of templates and facets in JSON format that guide tools such as QueryData in translating natural language questions into queries for a specific database. Defining context ensures high-accuracy SQL generation for common query patterns.

Ensure that the context set is accurate and comprehensive in its coverage of expected application queries to maximize accuracy.

Context sets can be created in the `us-central1`, `us-east1`, `europe-west4`, and `asia-southeast1` regions.

### Query templates

Query templates are a curated set of representative natural language questions with corresponding SQL queries. They also include explanations to provide a declarative rationale for the natural language-to-SQL generation.

A query template object looks similar to the following:

```
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "nl_query": "Count prague loan accounts",
      "sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" = 'Prague'",
      "intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in the Prague region?",
      "manifest": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in a given city?",
      "parameterized": {
        "parameterized_intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in $1",
        "parameterized_sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" = $1"
      }
    }
  ]
},
...
```

The main components of the query template JSON object are as follows:

-   `nl_query`: An example of a natural language query that tools such as QueryData handle.
-   `sql`: The SQL query for the natural language query.
-   `intent`: The goal or purpose of the natural language query. If not set, this value defaults to the natural language query.
-   `manifest`: A generalized, auto-generated form of the intent.
-   `parameterized_intent`: A templated, auto-generated form of the intent, with entity values replaced by parameters.
-   `parameterized_sql`: A templated, auto-generated form of the SQL query that corresponds to the parameterized intent.

### Query facets

Query facets are a curated set of representative natural language conditions with corresponding SQL predicates. Facets manage filtering and conditions, which enables query templates to perform faceted searches.

A query facet object looks similar to the following:

```
{
...
"facets": [
    {
      "sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN 6000 AND 10000",
      "intent": "Average salary between 6000 and 10000",
      "manifest": "Average salary between a given number and a given number",
      "parameterized": {
         "parameterized_intent": "Average salary between $1 and $2",
         "parameterized_sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN $1 AND $2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The main components of the facet JSON object are as follows:

-   `sql_snippet`: A SQL snippet. To avoid ambiguity, qualify column names with table names (for example, `table_name.column_name`).
-   `intent`: An explanation of the SQL predicate.
-   `manifest`: A generalized, auto-generated form of the intent.
-   `parameterized_intent`: A templated, auto-generated form of the intent, with entity values replaced by parameters.
-   `parameterized_sql_snippet`: A templated, auto-generated form of the sql\_snippet that corresponds to the parameterized intent.

### Value search queries

[_Value search queries_](/alloydb/docs/ai/build-context-gemini-cli#generate-value-search-queries) are developer-defined queries that use match functions to find values and their context within a database. Value linking uses the results of these queries to identify which tables and columns contain a matching value, understand the value's concept type, and correct misspellings.

The QueryData API uses value linking to more accurately convert natural language into SQL. By using value search queries, the API can correct misspellings and resolve value types based on database values, thus improving conversion accuracy.

Value linking improves natural language to SQL conversion accuracy. For example, if a user asks, "Are there any flights out of Heathrow?", the database might store the airport name as "London Heathrow". Without value linking, the generated SQL might filter by `WHERE name = 'Heathrow'` and return no results. Value search queries guide the agent to map "Heathrow" to the correct database value "London Heathrow" and its schema location (`airports.name`), ensuring that the generated SQL is accurate.

An example value search query is:

```
{
  ...
  "value_searches": [
    {
      "query": "SELECT $value as value, 'airports.iata' as columns, 'Airport IATA Code' as concept_type, 0 as distance, '{}'::text as context FROM \"airports\" T WHERE T.\"iata\" = $value",
      "concept_type": "Airport IATA Code",
      "description": "Exact match (Standard SQL) for 3-letter airport codes"
    },
    {
      "query": "WITH TrigramMetrics AS ( SELECT T.\"name\" AS original_value, (T.\"name\" <-> $value::text) AS normalized_dist FROM \"airports\" T WHERE T.\"name\" % $value::text ) SELECT original_value AS value, 'airports.name' AS columns, 'Airport Name' AS concept_type, normalized_dist AS distance, '{}'::text AS context FROM TrigramMetrics",
      "concept_type": "Airport Name",
      "description": "Fuzzy match using standard trigram for partial airport names"
    },
    {
      "query": "WITH SemanticMetrics AS ( SELECT T.\"city\" AS original_value, ( (google_ml.embedding('gemini-embedding-001', $value)::vector <=> google_ml.embedding('gemini-embedding-001', T.\"city\")::vector) / 2.0 ) AS normalized_dist FROM \"airports\" T WHERE T.\"city\" IS NOT NULL ) SELECT original_value AS value, 'airports.city' AS columns, 'Airport City' AS concept_type, normalized_dist AS distance, '{}'::text AS context FROM SemanticMetrics",
      "concept_type": "Airport City",
      "description": "Semantic search on string values for airport city names"
    }
  ]
}
```

The main components of the value search JSON object are as follows:

-   `query`: A parameterized SQL statement that defines the logic for matching a value phrase against the values stored in a column of a table in a database. The result set typically projects the matched value, the schema location, the concept type, and a normalized distance metric (between 0 and 1).
-   `concept_type`: A semantic label assigned to the value—for example, the `district` or the `loan_status`. This label helps value linking and eventually the tools such as QueryData API to understand the role of the value phrase in the schema. It also helps produce a SQL statement that targets the concept for the value, as well as the table and column where the value phrase appears in.
-   `description`: A description of the search logic.

## Limitations

Context sets have the following limitations:

-   Context sets for databases only supports templates, facets, and value searches.
-   Context sets for databases is only used by the `QueryData` endpoint in the Conversational Analytics API.
