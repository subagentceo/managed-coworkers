QueryData lets you to interact with the data in your database using conversational language and build data agents. QueryData writes queries for your database using context sets, which are collections of code that contain unique information about your database. This context allows QueryData to translate natural language questions into accurate queries for your target use cases.

## When to use QueryData

QueryData is ideal for applications such as:

-   **Customer service automation**: Handle high-volume inquiries like "Where is my order?" or "What is my current balance?".
-   **E-commerce shopping assistants**: Help users navigate large product catalogs with natural language queries like "Show me running shoes under $100."
-   **Field operations tools**: Allow mobile employees to query inventory levels, part availability, or service ticket details in real-time.

## How QueryData works

To build effective agentic applications, QueryData must understand your data organization and business logic. You provide this information in the form of context set.

You define context in files that contain JSON objects for each context type. You author these context files with the help of the [Gemini CLI](/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli). You then upload the context file to a context set that you create in the Google Cloud console. This process enables QueryData to learn the specific schema of the database and business logic of the application.

The context file looks similar to the following:

```
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "nl_query": "Count Prague loan accounts",
      "sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" ='Prague'",
      "intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in the Prague region?",
      "manifest": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in a given city?",
      "parameterized": {
        "parameterized_intent": "How many accounts associated with loans are located in $1",
        "parameterized_sql": "SELECT COUNT(T1.account_id) FROM bird_dev_financial.account AS T1 INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN bird_dev_financial.district AS T3 ON T1.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.\"A3\" = $1"
      }
    }
  ],
  "facets": [
    {
      "sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN 6000 AND 10000",
      "intent": "Average salary between 6000 and 10000",
      "manifest": "Average salary between a given number and a given number",
      "parameterized": {
         "parameterized_intent": "Average salary between $1 and $2",
         "parameterized_sql_snippet": "employee.\"A11\" BETWEEN $1 AND $2"
      }
    }
  ],
  "value_searches": [
    {
      "query": "SELECT $value as value, 'accounts.account_type' as columns, 'Account Type' as concept_type, 0 as distance, '{}'::text as context FROM \"accounts\" T WHERE T.\"account_type\" = $value",
      "concept_type": "Account Type",
      "description": "Exact match for account types"
    }
   ]
}
```

When an end user asks a natural language question, QueryData prioritizes matching the question to the templates and facets that have been audited by the developer curating the context. Once QueryData identifies a match, it uses the selected query template and facets to synthesize a database query. The context set logic then executes that query against the database to return accurate results.

A recommended step is to define value searches within your context. Value searches allow the agent to map value phrases to specific values stored in your database columns. This grounds the LLM in your actual data, helping it resolve ambiguities, such as whether a term refers to a `District` name or a `City`.

If the agent fails to find a matching template, then it uses value searches to map natural language phrases to specific values stored in your database columns. This grounds the LLM in your actual data, helping it resolve ambiguities, such as whether a term refers to a `District`, `Name`, or a `City`.

The `QueryData` endpoint in the [Conversational Analytics API](/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/overview#key_api_operations) is an agentic tool that allows programmatic integration with your applications to enable SQL query generation from natural language questions. In a conversational application, the `QueryData` endpoint must be used within the framework that manages the conversation history and context.To enforce entity resolution while maintaining strict row-level security, you can use parameterized secure views (PSVs). For more information, see [Secure and control access to application data using parameterized secure views](/alloydb/docs/ai/secure-app-data-parameterized-secure-views).
