# Create an IVFFLAT index Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

This page describes how to use stored embeddings to generate indexes and query embeddings using an `IVFFlat`index with AlloyDB. For more information about storing embedding, see [Store vector embeddings](/alloydb/docs/ai/store-embeddings).

**Note:** Before you create an index, verify that you add embedding vectors to a table in your AlloyDB database.

## Before you begin

Before you can start creating indexes, you must complete the following prerequisites.

-   [Embedding vectors are added to a table](/alloydb/docs/ai/store-embeddings) in your AlloyDB database.

-   The `vector` extension version `0.5.0` or later that is based on `pgvector`, extended by Google for AlloyDB is installed.

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    ```


## Create an `IVFFlat` index

Stock `pgvector` also provides a version of the `IVF` index named [`IVFFlat`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#ivfflat) that provides faster build time and has a smaller memory footprint as compared to the `hnsw` index.

To create an `IVFFlat` index, complete the following steps:

```
CREATE INDEX INDEX_NAME ON TABLE
  USING ivfflat (EMBEDDING_COLUMN DISTANCE_FUNCTION)
  WITH (lists = LIST_COUNT);
```

Replace the following:

-   `INDEX_NAME`: the name of the index you want to create—for example, `my-ivf-index`.

-   `TABLE`: the table to add the index to.

-   `EMBEDDING_COLUMN`: a column that stores `vector` data.

-   `DISTANCE_FUNCTION`: the distance function to use with this index. Choose one of the following:

    -   **L2 distance:** `vector_l2_ops`

    -   **Inner product:** `vector_ip_ops`

    -   **Cosine distance:** `vector_cosine_ops`

-   `LIST_COUNT`: the number of lists to use with this index. For more information about how to decide this value, see [Tune an IVFFlat index](/alloydb/docs/ai/tune-indexes).

    To create this index on an embedding column that uses the `real[]` data type instead of `vector`, cast the column into the `vector` data type:


```
CREATE INDEX INDEX_NAME ON TABLE
  USING ivfflat (CAST(EMBEDDING_COLUMN AS vector(DIMENSIONS)))'}} DISTANCE_FUNCTION)
  WITH (lists = LIST_COUNT);
```

Replace `DIMENSIONS` with the dimensional width of the embedding column. For more information about how to find the dimensions, see the `vector_dims` function in [Vector functions](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-functions).

To view the indexing progress, use the `pg_stat_progress_create_index` view:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;
```

The `phase` column shows the current state of your index creation.

To tune your index for a target recall and QPS balance, see [Tune an `IVFFlat` index](/alloydb/docs/ai/tune-indexes).

## Run a query

After you store and index the embeddings in your database, you can start querying using the [`pgvector` query functionality](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#querying).

To find the nearest semantic neighbors for an embedding vector, you can run the following example query, where you set the same distance function that you used during the index creation.

  ```
  SELECT * FROM TABLE
    ORDER BY EMBEDDING_COLUMN DISTANCE_FUNCTION_QUERY ['EMBEDDING']
    LIMIT ROW_COUNT
```

Replace the following:

-   `TABLE`: the table containing the embedding to compare the text to.

-   `INDEX_NAME`: the name of the index you want to use—for example, `my-scann-index`.

-   `EMBEDDING_COLUMN`: the column containing the stored embeddings.

-   `DISTANCE_FUNCTION_QUERY`: the distance function to use with this query. Choose one of the following based on the distance function used while creating the index:

    -   **L2 distance:** `<->`

    -   **Inner product:** `<#>`

    -   **Cosine distance:** `<=>`

-   `EMBEDDING`: the embedding vector you want to find the nearest stored semantic neighbors of.

-   `ROW_COUNT`: the number of rows to return.

    Specify `1` if you want only the single best match.


For more information about other query examples, see [Querying](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#querying).

You can also use the [`embedding()`](/alloydb/docs/ai/work-with-embeddings) function to translate the text into a vector. You apply the vector to one of the `pgvector` nearest-neighbor operators, `<->` for L2 distance, to find the database rows with the most semantically similar embeddings.

Because `embedding()` returns a `real` array, you must explicitly cast the `embedding()` call to `vector` in order to use these values with `pgvector` operators.
