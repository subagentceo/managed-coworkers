# AI in Clay

A comprehensive guide to how Clay uses AI across its features.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/687563213dfbc91a782122b1/691d4e5421aa15e276c6ab37_Web%20Scraping.avif)

Overview

A comprehensive guide to how Clay uses AI across its features, with a focus on data privacy, security, and responsible AI practices.

**Your data is never used for AI model training.** Clay has contractual agreements with all AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others) that strictly prohibit using customer data to train their models.

## Core AI principles

Clay is committed to transparent and responsible AI use. Here's what you need to know:

-   **No training on your data**: Customer data is never used to train Clay's AI models or those of our AI providers.
-   **Enterprise-grade security**: Industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit, with SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance.
-   **You control your data**: As a data processor, Clay only uses your data to provide services to you.
-   **Transparent partnerships**: Full list of AI subprocessors available at [trust.clay.com](http://trust.clay.com).

## AI features in Clay

### Email sequencer

**What it does**: Email Sequencer is Clay's built-in email outreach tool that lets you run email campaigns directly from your tables, using AI to create personalized messaging at scale.

[View Email Sequencer documentation →](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/email-sequencer)

**How AI is used**:

-   AI generates email copy based on your business context and prospect information.
-   AI snippets within messages automatically create personalized content using lead data.
-   Content generation happens in real-time when you create campaigns.

**Data privacy**:

-   Your campaign data and prospect information are processed only to generate your email content.
-   Data is not used to train models or shared with other Clay customers.
-   You can optionally use your own API keys with supported providers.

### Message drafting

**What it does**: AI-powered message drafting within Clay tables helps you create personalized outreach messages for individual prospects.

[View Email sequencer documentation →](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/email-sequencer)

**How AI is used**:

-   AI reads context from your table columns (company info, prospect details, etc.).
-   Generates tailored messages based on your prompts and business context.
-   Uses your "My Business Context" settings to maintain brand voice.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only the specific table data you select is sent to AI models.
-   No training occurs on your messaging or prospect data.
-   Access is controlled by Clay's role-based permissions.

### Use AI action

**What it does**: A powerful table action that gives you access to AI for web research, content generation, and image generation.

[View Use AI documentation →](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/use-ai-integration-overview)

**How AI is used**:

-   **Web research**: AI searches and synthesizes information from the web.

-   **Image generation**: Creates images based on text prompts.

**Model options**:

-   Access to models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other leading AI providers.
-   Option to bring your own API keys for supported providers.
-   MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support when using your own keys.
-   Different models offer different capabilities (document upload, specialized research, etc.).

**Data privacy**:

-   Data from your table rows is only sent to AI when you explicitly run the action.
-   You control which columns are included as context.
-   Contractual agreements prohibit training on customer data.

### Claygents

**What it does**: Build repeatable AI agents for web research and prospecting that can navigate websites, extract information, and make decisions.

**How AI is used**:

-   AI agents follow your instructions to research prospects, companies, or topics.
-   Navigate web pages and extract specific information.
-   Make intelligent decisions about which sources to consult.

**Data privacy**:

-   Claygents process data row-by-row as they run.
-   Research results are stored in your table, under your control.
-   No customer data used for training agent capabilities.

### Sculptor

**What it does**: A chat interface for Clay that helps with table building, debugging, and analysis using conversational AI.

[View Sculptor documentation →](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/sculptor)

**How AI is used**:

-   Reads your "My Business Context" to understand your goals.
-   Accesses information in your current table to provide relevant help.
-   Suggests formulas, identifies issues, and helps analyze data.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only accesses the specific table you're working in.
-   Uses table metadata and visible data to provide context-aware assistance.
-   Chat history and table context are not used for training.
-   Data is processed transiently to provide real-time assistance.

### Formula generator

**What it does**: AI-powered tool that helps you create Clay formulas using natural language.

**How AI is used**:

-   Converts your natural language description into working formulas.
-   Understands Clay's formula syntax and functions.
-   Suggests appropriate formulas based on your use case.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only your formula description and relevant table schema are sent to AI.
-   Actual row data is not transmitted.
-   Generated formulas are not used to train models.

### API generator

**What it does**: Helps you build HTTP API requests using AI, making it easier to connect to external services.

[View HTTP API documentation →](https://www.clay.com/university/guide/http-api-integration-overview)

**How AI is used**:

-   Generates API request configurations based on your description.
-   Understands common API patterns and authentication methods.
-   Suggests appropriate parameters and headers.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only your API description is sent to AI models.
-   API keys and credentials are never sent to AI providers.
-   Generated configurations are not used for training.

### Debug with AI

**What it does**: When errors occur in Clay, AI helps diagnose and suggest fixes using error logs and Clay documentation.

**How AI is used**:

-   Analyzes error messages and logs.
-   References Clay's documentation to suggest solutions.
-   Provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only error logs and relevant system information are sent to AI.
-   Personal data in your tables is not included in debug requests.
-   Debug data is not used to train models.

### Find companies with natural language

**What it does**: An import feature that lets you describe your ideal customer profile (ICP) and searches Clay's database of 50M+ companies.

**How AI is used**:

-   Interprets your natural language ICP description.
-   Converts your criteria into database queries.
-   Ranks and filters companies based on fit.

**Data privacy**:

-   Only your ICP description is processed by AI.
-   Search results come from Clay's company database, not your data.
-   Your search criteria are not shared with other customers.
-   No training occurs on your ICP descriptions.

## Data Security and Compliance

### Encryption

-   **At rest**: All customer data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption.
-   **In transit**: TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption for all data transmission.
